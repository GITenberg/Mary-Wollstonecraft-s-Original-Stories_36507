<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>EDITOR&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The germ of the <i>Original Stories</i> was, I imagine, a
suggestion (in the manner of publishers) from Mary
Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s employer, Johnson of St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, that something more or less in the manner of Mrs.
Trimmer&rsquo;s <i>History of the Robins</i>, the great nursery
success of 1786, might be a profitable speculation.&nbsp; For I
doubt if the production of a book for children would ever have
occurred spontaneously to an author so much more interested in
the status of women and other adult matters.&nbsp; However, the
idea being given her, she quickly wrote the book&mdash;in 1787 or
1788&mdash;carrying out in it to a far higher power, in Mrs.
Mason, the self-confidence and rectitude of Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s
leading lady, Mrs. Benson, who in her turn had been preceded by
that other flawless instructor of youth, Mr. Barlow.&nbsp; None
of these exemplars could do wrong; but the Mrs. Mason whom we
meet in the following pages far transcends the others in
conscious merit.&nbsp; Mrs. Benson in the <i>History of the
Robins</i> (with the author of which Mary Wollstonecraft was on
friendly terms) was sufficiently like the Protagonist of the Old
Testament to be, when among Mrs. Wilson&rsquo;s bees,
&lsquo;excessively pleased with the ingenuity and industry <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>with which
these insects collect their honey and wax, form their cells, and
deposit their store&rsquo;; but Mrs. Mason, as we shall see, went
still farther.</p>
<p>It has to be remembered that the <i>Original Stories</i> were
written when the author was twenty-nine, five years before she
met Gilbert Imlay and six years before her daughter Fanny Imlay
was born.&nbsp; I mention this fact because it seems to me to be
very significant.&nbsp; I feel that had the book been written
after Fanny&rsquo;s birth, or even after the Imlay infatuation,
it would have been somewhat different: not perhaps more
entertaining, because its author had none of that imaginative
sympathy with the young which would direct her pen in the
direction of pure pleasure for them; but more human, more kindly,
better.&nbsp; One can have indeed little doubt as to this after
reading those curious first lessons for an infant which came from
Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s pen in or about 1795, (printed in
volume two of the <i>Posthumous Works</i>, 1798), and which give
evidence of so much more tenderness and reasonableness (and at
the same time want of Reason, which may have been Godwin&rsquo;s
God but will never stand in that relation either to English men
or English children) than the monitress of the <i>Original
Stories</i>, the impeccable Mrs. Mason, ever suggests.&nbsp; I
know of no early instance where a mother talks down to an infant
more prettily: continually descending herself to its level, yet
never with any of Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s arrogance and
superiority.&nbsp; Not indeed that this poor mother, <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>with her
impulsive warm heart wounded, and most of her illusions gone, and
few kindly eyes resting upon her, could ever have compassed much
of Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s prosperous self-satisfaction and authority
had she wished to; for in the seven years between the composition
of the <i>Original Stories</i> and the lessons for the minute
Fanny Imlay, she had lived an emotional lifetime, and suffering
much, pitied much.</p>
<p>In Lesson X, which I quote, although it says nothing of
charity or kindness, a vastly more human spirit is found than in
any of Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s homilies on our duty to the
afflicted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>See how much taller you are than William.&nbsp; In
four years you have learned to eat, to walk, to talk.&nbsp; Why
do you smile?&nbsp; You can do much more, you think: you can wash
your hands and face.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; I should never kiss a
dirty face.&nbsp; And you can comb your head with the pretty comb
you always put by in your own drawer.&nbsp; To be sure, you do
all this to be ready to take a walk with me.&nbsp; You would be
obliged to stay at home, if you could not comb your own
hair.&nbsp; Betty is busy getting the dinner ready, and only
brushes William&rsquo;s hair, because he cannot do it for
himself.</p>
<p>Betty is making an apple-pye.&nbsp; You love an apple-pye; but
I do not bid you make one.&nbsp; Your hands are not strong enough
to mix the butter and flour together; and you must not try to
pare the apples, because you cannot manage a great knife.</p>
<p>Never touch the large knives: they are very sharp, and you
might cut your finger to the bone.&nbsp; You are a little girl,
and ought to have a little knife.&nbsp; When you are as tall as I
am, you shall have a knife as <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>large as mine; and when you are as
strong as I am, and have learned to manage it, you will not hurt
yourself.</p>
<p>You can trundle a hoop, you say; and jump over a stick.&nbsp;
O, I forgot!&mdash;and march like men in the red coats, when papa
plays a pretty tune on the fiddle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even a very little of the tender spirit that this lesson
breathes, even a very little of its sense of play, would have
leavened the <i>Original Stories</i> into a more wholesome
consistency.&nbsp; As it stands, that book is one of the most
perfect examples of the success with which, a century or more
ago, any ingratiating quality could be kept out of a work for the
young.&nbsp; According to William Godwin, his unhappy wife had
always a pretty and endearing way with children.&nbsp; Yet of
pretty and endearing ways, as of humour, I take him to have been
a bad judge; for I do not think that any woman possessing enough
sympathy to attach children to her as he, in one of the most
curious biographies in the language, assures us that she had,
could have suppressed the gift so completely in her first book
for young minds.&nbsp; And the Mrs. Masonic character of her own
Preface supports my view.</p>
<p>I do not wish to suggest that previous to 1787 Mary
Wollstonecraft had been a stranger to suffering.&nbsp; Far from
it.&nbsp; Her life had known little joy.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s
excesses, her mother&rsquo;s grief and poverty, her
sister&rsquo;s misfortunes, her own homelessness, and, to crown
all, the death of her close friend Frances Blood, must have
dimmed if not obliterated most of her <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>happy impulses.&nbsp; But it is one
thing to suffer bereavement and to be anxious about the troubles
of others near and dear; and it is quite another to suffer
oneself by loving, even to a point of personal disaster, and then
losing both that love and the friendliness (such as it was) of
the world.&nbsp; Imlay&rsquo;s desertion and the birth of Fanny
were real things beside which a drunken father, unhappy sisters,
and a dead friend were mere trifles.</p>
<p>This little book is to my mind chiefly interesting for two
reasons apart from its original purpose&mdash;for the light it
throws on the attitude of the nursery authors of that day towards
children, and for the character of Mrs. Mason, a type of the
dominant British character, in petticoats, here for the first
time (so far as my reading goes) set on paper.</p>
<p>I have no information regarding the success of the <i>Original
Stories</i> in their day, and such spirited efforts as are now
made to obtain them by collectors are, we know, due rather to
Blake than to Mary Wollstonecraft; but any measure of popularity
that they may have enjoyed illustrates the awful state of slavery
in which the children of the seventeen-nineties must have
subsisted.&nbsp; It is indeed wonderful to me to think that only
a poor hundred years ago such hard and arid presentations of
adult perfection and infantile incapacity should have been
considered, even by capable writers, all that the intelligence of
children needed or their tender inexperience deserved.&nbsp; I do
not deny that children are not to-day too much <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>considered: indeed, I think that they are: I think
there is now an unfortunate tendency to provide them with
literature in such variety as to anticipate, and possibly
supplant, the most valuable natural workings of their minds in
almost every direction; but such activity at any rate indicates a
desire on the part of the writers of these books to understand
their readers, whereas I can detect none in the <i>Original
Stories</i> or in hundreds of kindred works of that day.&nbsp;
<i>Sandford and Merton</i> and Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s book stand
apart: there is much humanity and imaginative sympathy in both;
but with the majority of nursery authors, to fling down a
collection of homilies was sufficient.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that every one was equally thoughtless: it is
not merely that Mary Wollstonecraft should consider such an
intellectual stone as Chapter XV worth preparing for poor little
fellow creatures that needed bread; but that her publisher
Johnson should consider it the kind of thing to send forth, and
that, with artists capable of dramatic interest available, he
should hand the commission to illustrate it to William Blake,
who, exquisitely charming as were his drawings for his own
<i>Songs</i>, was as yet in no sense of the word an ingratiating
illustrator of narratives of real life for young eyes.&nbsp; And
there still remains the parent or friend who, picking up the book
in a shop, considered it the kind of thing to strike a bliss into
the soul of Master Henry or Miss Susan as a birthday
present.&nbsp; <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>It is all, at this date, so incredible, so shortsighted,
so cruel, one could almost say.&nbsp; No one seems to have tried
at all: the idea of wooing a child was not in the
air&mdash;certainly Mary Wollstonecraft had none of it.</p>
<p>Who it was that first discerned the child to be a thing of
joy, a character apart worth coming to without patronage, a
flower, a fairy, I cannot say.&nbsp; But Blake, in his writings,
had much to do with the discovery, and Wordsworth perhaps
more.&nbsp; Certain, however, is it that Mary Wollstonecraft,
even if she had glimmerings of this truth, had no more; and those
she suppressed when the pen was in her hand.</p>
<p>I might remark here that the circumstance that Blake&rsquo;s
drawings for Salzmann&rsquo;s <i>Elements of Morality</i>, which
Mary Wollstonecraft translated in 1791, also for Johnson, are
more interesting and dramatic, is due to the fact that he merely
adapted the work of the German artist.&nbsp; Blake was uniformly
below himself in this kind of employment.&nbsp; Only in the rapt
freedoms of the angelic harper in his hut, in the picture
opposite page 56 of the present work, does he approach his true
genius; while in his conception of Mrs. Mason I have no
confidence.&nbsp; Not slim and willowy and pensive was she in my
mental picture of her: I figure a matron of sterner stuff and
solider build.</p>
<p>But having said this against the <i>Original Stories</i>, I
have said all, for as the casket enshrining Mrs. Mason its value
remains unassailable.</p>
<p>It was well for Mrs. Mason that Mary Wollstonecraft <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>set her on
paper in 1788.&nbsp; Had she waited until the <i>Vindication of
the Rights of Women</i> was written in 1792 (and dedicated to
Talleyrand), had she waited until little Fanny Imlay was born
into a stony world, Mrs. Mason would never have been.&nbsp;
Because it is the likes of Mrs. Mason that keep the rights of
women, as Mary Wollstonecraft saw them, in the background, and
demand the production of marriage lines.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason would
have been the first to regret the unwomanliness of the
publication both of the book and of the baby.&nbsp; The Preface
to this book suggests that Mary Wollstonecraft was at that time,
before she had loved and lost and suffered, something of a Mrs.
Mason herself; but Mrs. Mason remained Masonic to the end,
whereas poor Mary&rsquo;s heart and mind were always in
conflict.&nbsp; She may have loved pure Reason, but she loved
Gilbert Imlay too.&nbsp; And this Mrs. Mason never did.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason never nods.&nbsp; Her tact, her mental reaction,
her confidence, her sense of duty and knowledge of duty, are
alike marvellous.&nbsp; When the higher mercy compels her to end
a wounded lark&rsquo;s misery by putting her foot on its head,
she &lsquo;turns her own the other way&rsquo;.&nbsp; At the close
of a walk during which her charges have been
&lsquo;rational&rsquo;, she shakes hands with them.&nbsp; Her
highest praise to Mary, after the fruit-picking incident on page
40, is to call her &lsquo;my friend&rsquo;; &lsquo;and she
deserved the name,&rsquo; adds the lady, &lsquo;for she was no
longer a child.&rsquo;&nbsp; No child could be her friend.&nbsp;
One wonders what she made of the <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>beautiful words &lsquo;Suffer the
little children to come unto Me . . . for of such is the kingdom
of Heaven&rsquo;; but of course she did not know them: her
Testament was obviously the Old.</p>
<p>Yet we have, as it happens, a comment on Christ&rsquo;s
remark, in her statement on page 8, made in one of her recurring
monologues on superiority and inferiority, that it is &lsquo;only
to animals that children <i>can</i> do good&rsquo;.&nbsp; Mrs.
Mason&rsquo;s expression of alarm and dismay on hearing the words
&lsquo;A little child shall lead them&rsquo; could be drawn
adequately, one feels, only by Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s friend
Fuseli.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I govern my servants and you,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mason,
&lsquo;by attending strictly to truth, and this observance
keeping my head clear and my heart pure, I am ever ready to pray
to the Author of Good, the Fountain of truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
never paid unmeaning compliments, (and here it is interesting to
compare the second paragraph of Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s
Preface, where she plays at being a Mrs. Mason too), or permitted
any word to drop from her tongue that her heart did not
dictate.&nbsp; Hence she allowed Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s <i>History
of the Robins</i> to be lent to a little girl, only on condition
that the little girl should be made to understand that birds
cannot really talk.&nbsp; She had in her garden, although large,
only one bed of tulips, because the tulip flaunts, whereas the
rose, of which she had a profusion, is modest.&nbsp; That God
made both does not seem to have troubled her.&nbsp; She thought
that the poor who were willing to work <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>&lsquo;had
a right to the comforts of life&rsquo;.&nbsp; During a
thunderstorm she walked with the same security as when the sun
enlivened the prospect, since her love of virtue had overcome her
fear of death.&nbsp; She was weaned from the world, &lsquo;but
not disgusted.&rsquo;&nbsp; When she visited those who have been
reduced from their original place in society by misfortunes, she
made such alterations in her dress as would suggest ceremony,
lest too much familiarity should appear like disrespect.&nbsp;
She forbade Caroline to cry when in pain, because the Most High
was educating her for eternity.&nbsp; She thought that all
diseases were sent to children by the Almighty to teach them
patience and fortitude.&nbsp; She never sought bargains, wishing
every one to receive the just value for their goods; and when her
two charges at last left her, to return to their father, she
dismissed them with the words, &lsquo;You are now candidates for
my friendship, and on your advancement in virtue my regard will
in future depend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great fault of Mrs. Mason is that she had none.&nbsp; One
seems to understand why her own children and husband died so
quickly.</p>
<p>Since I have read this little book a new kind of nightmare has
come into my slumbers: I dream that I am walking with Mrs.
Mason.&nbsp; The greatness and goodness of Mrs. Mason surround
me, dominate me, suffocate me.&nbsp; With head erect, vigilant
eye, and a smile of assurance and tolerance on her massive
features, she sails on and on, holding my <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>neatly-gloved hand, discoursing ever of the infinite
mercy of God, the infinite paltriness of myself, and the infinite
success of Mrs. Mason.&nbsp; I think that Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s most
terrible characteristic to me (who have never been quite sure of
anything) is the readiness with which her decisions spring
fully-armed from her brain.&nbsp; She knows not only everything,
but herself too: she has no doubts.&nbsp; Here she joins hands
with so much that is most triumphant in the British
character.&nbsp; The Briton also is without doubts.&nbsp; He
marches forward.&nbsp; He is right.&nbsp; It is when I
contemplate him in this mood&mdash;and Mrs. Mason too&mdash;that
I most wonder who my ancestors can have been.</p>
<p>The awful reality of Mrs. Mason proves that Mary
Wollstonecraft, had she known her own power and kept her mental
serenity, might have been a great novelist.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason was
the first and strongest British Matron.&nbsp; She came before
Mrs. Proudie, and also, it is interesting to note, before Sir
Willoughby Patterne.&nbsp; But she was, I fear, an accident; for
there is nothing like her in our author&rsquo;s one experiment in
adult fiction, <i>The Wrongs of Woman</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>These conversations and tales are accommodated to the present
state of society; which obliges the author to attempt to cure
those faults by reason, which might never to have taken root in
the infant mind.&nbsp; Good habits, imperceptibly fixed, are far
preferable to the precepts of reason; but, as this task requires
more judgment than generally falls to the lot of parents,
substitutes must be sought for, and medicines given, when regimen
would have answered the purpose much better.&nbsp; I believe
those who examine their own minds, will readily agree with me,
that reason, with difficulty, conquers settled habits, even when
it is arrived at some degree of maturity: why then do we suffer
children to be bound with fetters, which their half-formed
faculties cannot break.</p>
<p>In writing the following work, I aim at perspicuity and
simplicity of style; and try to avoid those unmeaning
compliments, which slip from the tongue, but have not the least
connexion with the affections that should warm the heart, and
animate the conduct.&nbsp; By this false politeness, sincerity is
sacrificed, and truth violated; and thus artificial manners are
necessarily taught.&nbsp; For true politeness is a polish, not a
varnish; and should rather be acquired by observation than
admonition.&nbsp; And we may remark, by way <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>of
illustration, that men do not attempt to polish precious stones,
till age and air have given them that degree of solidity, which
will enable them to bear the necessary friction, without
destroying the main substance.</p>
<p>The way to render instruction most useful cannot always be
adopted; knowledge should be gradually imparted, and flow more
from example than teaching: example directly addresses the
senses, the first inlets to the heart; and the improvement of
those instruments of the understanding is the object education
should have constantly in view, and over which we have most
power.&nbsp; But to wish that parents would, themselves, mould
the ductile passions, is a chimerical wish, for the present
generation have their own passions to combat with, and fastidious
pleasures to pursue, neglecting those pointed out by nature: we
must therefore pour premature knowledge into the succeeding one;
and, teaching virtue, explain the nature of vice.&nbsp; Cruel
necessity!</p>
<p>The Conversations are intended to assist the teacher as well
as the pupil; and this will obviate an objection which some may
start, that the sentiments are not quite on a level with the
capacity of a child.&nbsp; Every child requires a different mode
of treatment; but a writer can only choose one, and that must be
modified by those who are actually engaged with young people in
their studies.</p>
<p>The tendency of the reasoning obviously tends to fix
principles of truth and humanity on a solid and <a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>simple
foundation; and to make religion an active, invigorating director
of the affections, and not a mere attention to forms.&nbsp;
Systems of Theology may be complicated, but when the character of
the Supreme Being is displayed, and He is recognised as the
Universal Father, the Author and Centre of Good, a child may be
led to comprehend that dignity and happiness must arise from
imitating Him; and this conviction should be twisted
into&mdash;and be the foundation of every inculcated duty.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Tales, which were written to illustrate the
moral, may recall it, when the mind has gained sufficient
strength to discuss the argument from which it was deduced.</p>

xx</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Mary and Caroline, though the children of wealthy parents
were, in their infancy, left entirely to the management of
servants, or people equally ignorant.&nbsp; Their mother died
suddenly, and their father, who found them very troublesome at
home, placed them under the tuition of a woman of tenderness and
discernment, a near relation, who was induced to take on herself
the important charge through motives of compassion.</p>
<p>They were shamefully ignorant, considering that Mary had been
fourteen, and Caroline twelve years in the world.&nbsp; If they
had been merely ignorant, the task would not have appeared so
arduous; but they had caught every prejudice that the vulgar
casually instill.&nbsp; In order to eradicate these prejudices,
and substitute good habits instead of those they had carelessly
contracted, Mrs. Mason never suffered them to be out of her
sight.&nbsp; They were allowed to ask questions on all occasions,
a method she would not have adopted, had she educated them from
the first, according to the suggestions of her own reason, to
which experience had given its sanction.</p>
<p>They had tolerable capacities; but Mary had a turn for
ridicule, and Caroline was vain of her person.&nbsp; She was,
indeed, very handsome, and the inconsiderate encomiums that had,
in her presence, been lavished on her beauty made her, even at
that early age, affected.</p>

CONVERSATIONS AND STORIES</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The treatment of animals.&mdash;The
ant.&mdash;The bee.&mdash;Goodness.&mdash;The lark&rsquo;s
nest.&mdash;The asses.</p>
<p>One fine morning in spring, some time after Mary and Caroline
were settled in their new abode, Mrs. Mason proposed a walk
before breakfast, a custom she wished to teach imperceptibly, by
rendering it amusing.</p>
<p>The sun had scarcely dispelled the dew that hung on every
blade of grass, and filled the half-shut flowers; every prospect
smiled, and the freshness of the air conveyed the most pleasing
sensations to Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s mind; but the children were
regardless of the surrounding beauties, and ran eagerly after
some insects to destroy them.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason silently observed
their cruel sports, without appearing to do it; but stepping
suddenly out of the foot-path into the long grass, her buckle was
caught in it, and striving to disentangle herself, she wet her
feet; which the children knew she wished to avoid, as she had
been lately sick.&nbsp; This circumstance roused their attention;
and they forgot their amusement to enquire why she had left the
path; and Mary could hardly restrain a laugh, when she was
informed that it was to avoid treading on some snails that were
creeping across the narrow footway.&nbsp; Surely, said Mary, you
do not think there is any harm in killing a snail, or any of <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>those nasty
creatures that crawl on the ground?&nbsp; I hate them, and should
scream if one was to find its way from my clothes to my
neck!&nbsp; With great gravity, Mrs. Mason asked how she dared to
kill any thing, unless it were to prevent its hurting her?&nbsp;
Then, resuming a smiling face, she said, Your education has been
neglected, my child; as we walk along attend to what I say, and
make the best answers you can; and do you, Caroline, join in the
conversation.</p>
<p>You have already heard that God created the world, and every
inhabitant of it.&nbsp; He is then called the Father of all
creatures; and all are made to be happy, whom a good and wise God
has created.&nbsp; He made those snails you despise, and
caterpillars, and spiders; and when He made them, did not leave
them to perish, but placed them where the food that is most
proper to nourish them is easily found.&nbsp; They do not live
long, but He who is their Father, as well as your&rsquo;s,
directs them to deposit their eggs on the plants that are fit to
support their young, when they are not able to get food for
themselves.&mdash;And when such a great and wise Being has taken
care to provide every thing necessary for the meanest creature,
would you dare to kill it, merely because it appears to you
ugly?&nbsp; Mary began to be attentive, and quickly followed Mrs.
Mason&rsquo;s example, who allowed a caterpillar and a spider to
creep on her hand.&nbsp; You find them, she rejoined, very
harmless; but a great number would destroy our vegetables and
fruit; so birds are permitted to eat them, as we feed on animals;
and in spring there are always more than at any other season of
the year, to furnish food for the young broods.&mdash;Half
convinced, Mary said, but worms are of little consequence in the
world.&nbsp; Yet, replied Mrs. Mason, God cares for them, and
gives them every thing that is necessary to render their
existence comfortable.&nbsp; <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>You are often troublesome&mdash;I am
stronger than you&mdash;yet I do not kill you.</p>
<p>Observe those ants; they have a little habitation in yonder
hillock; they carry food to it for their young, and sleep very
snug in it during the cold weather.&nbsp; The bees also have
comfortable towns, and lay up a store of honey to support them
when the flowers die, and snow covers the ground: and this
forecast is as much the gift of God, as any quality you
possess.</p>
<p>Do you know the meaning of the word Goodness?&nbsp; I see you
are unwilling to answer.&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; It is,
first, to avoid hurting any thing; and then, to contrive to give
as much pleasure as you can.&nbsp; If some insects are to be
destroyed, to preserve my garden from desolation, I have it done
in the quickest way.&nbsp; The domestic animals that I keep, I
provide the best food for, and never suffer them to be tormented;
and this caution arises from two motives:&mdash;I wish to make
them happy; and, as I love my fellow-creatures still better than
the brute creation, I would not allow those that I have any
influence over, to grow habitually thoughtless and cruel, till
they were unable to relish the greatest pleasure life
affords,&mdash;that of resembling God, by doing good.</p>
<p>A lark now began to sing, as it soared aloft.&nbsp; The
children watched its motions, listening to the artless
melody.&nbsp; They wondered what it was thinking of&mdash;of its
young family, they soon concluded; for it flew over the hedge,
and drawing near, they heard the young ones chirp.&nbsp; Very
soon both the old birds took their flight together, to look for
food to satisfy the craving of the almost fledged young.&nbsp; An
idle boy, who had borrowed a gun, fired at them&mdash;they fell;
and before he could take up the wounded pair, he perceived Mrs.
Mason; and expecting a very <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>severe reprimand, ran away.&nbsp; She
and the little girls drew near, and found that one was not much
hurt; but that the other, the cock, had one leg broken, and both
its wings shattered; and its little eyes seemed starting out of
their sockets, it was in such exquisite pain.&nbsp; The children
turned away their eyes.&nbsp; Look at it, said Mrs. Mason; do you
not see that it suffers as much, and more than you did when you
had the small-pox, when you were so tenderly nursed.&nbsp; Take
up the hen; I will bind her wing together; perhaps it may
heal.&nbsp; As to the cock, though I hate to kill any thing, I
must put him out of pain; to leave him in his present state would
be cruel; and avoiding an unpleasant sensation myself, I should
allow the poor bird to die by inches, and call this treatment
tenderness, when it would be selfishness or weakness.&nbsp;
Saying so, she put her foot on the bird&rsquo;s head, turning her
own another way.</p>
<p>They walked on; when Caroline remarked, that the nestlings,
deprived of their parents, would now perish; and the mother began
to flutter in her hand as they drew near the hedge, though the
poor creature could not fly, yet she tried to do it.&nbsp; The
girls, with one voice, begged Mrs. Mason to let them take the
nest, and provide food in a cage, and see if the mother could not
contrive to hop about to feed them.&nbsp; The nest and the old
mother were instantly in Mary&rsquo;s handkerchief.&nbsp; A
little opening was left to admit the air; and Caroline peeped
into it every moment to see how they looked.&nbsp; I give you
leave, said Mrs. Mason, to take those birds, because an accident
has rendered them helpless; if that had not been the case, they
should not have been confined.</p>
<p>They had scarcely reached the next field, when they met
another boy with a nest in his hand, and on a tree near him saw
the mother, who, forgetting her <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>natural timidity, followed the
spoiler; and her intelligible tones of anguish reached the ears
of the children, whose hearts now first felt the emotions of
humanity.&nbsp; Caroline called him, and taking sixpence out of
her little purse, offered to give it to him for the nest, if he
would shew her where he had taken it from.&nbsp; The boy
consented, and away ran Caroline to replace it,&mdash;crying all
the way, how delighted the old bird will be to find her brood
again.&nbsp; The pleasure that the parent-bird would feel was
talked of till they came to a large common, and heard some young
asses, at the door of an hovel, making a most dreadful
noise.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason had ordered the old ones to be confined,
lest the young should suck before the necessary quantity had been
saved for some sick people in her neighbourhood.&nbsp; But after
they had given the usual quantity of milk, the thoughtless boy
had left them still in confinement, and the young in vain
implored the food nature designed for their particular
support.&nbsp; Open the hatch, said Mrs. Mason, the mothers have
still enough left to satisfy their young.&nbsp; It was opened,
and they saw them suck.</p>
<p>Now, said she, we will return to breakfast; give me your
hands, my little girls, you have done good this morning, you have
acted like rational creatures.&nbsp; Look, what a fine morning it
is.&nbsp; Insects, birds, and animals, are all enjoying this
sweet day.&nbsp; Thank God for permitting you to see it, and for
giving you an understanding which teaches you that you ought, by
doing good, to imitate Him.&nbsp; Other creatures only think of
supporting themselves; but man is allowed to ennoble his nature,
by cultivating his mind and enlarging his heart.&nbsp; He feels
disinterested love; every part of the creation affords an
exercise for virtue, and virtue is ever the truest source of
pleasure.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
II</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The treatment of animals.&mdash;The difference
between them and man.&mdash;Parental affection of a
dog.&mdash;Brutality punished.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Mrs. Mason gave the children <i>Mrs.
Trimmer&rsquo;s Fabulous Histories</i>; and the subject still
turned on animals, and the wanton cruelty of those who treated
them improperly.&nbsp; The little girls were eager to express
their detestation, and requested that in future they might be
allowed to feed the chickens.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason complied with
their request; only one condition was annexed to the permission,
that they did it regularly.&nbsp; When you wait for your food,
you learn patience, she added, and you can mention your wants;
but those helpless creatures cannot complain.&nbsp; The country
people frequently say,&mdash;How can you treat a poor dumb beast
ill; and a stress is very properly laid on the word
dumb;&mdash;for dumb they appear to those who do not observe
their looks and gestures; but God, who takes care of every thing,
understands their language; and so did Caroline this morning,
when she ran with such eagerness to re-place the nest which the
thoughtless boy had stolen, heedless of the mother&rsquo;s
agonizing cries!</p>
<p>Mary interrupted her, to ask, if insects and animals were not
inferior to men; Certainly, answered Mrs. Mason; and men are
inferior to angels; yet we have reason to believe, that those
exalted beings delight to do us good.&nbsp; You have heard in a
book, which I seldom permit you to read, because you are not of
an age to understand it, that angels, when they sang glory to God
on high, wished for peace on earth, as a proof of the good will
they felt towards <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>men.&nbsp; And all the glad tidings that have been sent
to men, angels have proclaimed: indeed, the word angel signifies
a messenger.&nbsp; In order to please God, and our happiness
depends upon pleasing him, we must do good.&nbsp; What we call
virtue, may be thus explained:&mdash;we exercise every benevolent
affection to enjoy comfort here, and to fit ourselves to be
angels hereafter.&nbsp; And when we have acquired human virtues,
we shall have a nobler employment in our Father&rsquo;s
kingdom.&nbsp; But between angels and men a much greater
resemblance subsists, than between men and the brute creation;
because the two former seem capable of improvement.</p>
<p>The birds you saw to-day do not improve&mdash;or their
improvement only tends to self-preservation; the first nest they
make and the last are exactly the same; though in their flights
they must see many others more beautiful if not more convenient,
and, had they reason, they would probably shew something like
individual taste in the form of their dwellings; but this is not
the case.&nbsp; You saw the hen tear the down from her breast to
make a nest for her eggs; you saw her beat the grain with her
bill, and not swallow a bit, till the young were satisfied; and
afterwards she covered them with her wings, and seemed perfectly
happy, while she watched over her charge; if any one approached,
she was ready to defend them, at the hazard of her life: yet, a
fortnight hence, you will see the same hen drive the fledged
chickens from the corn, and forget the fondness that seemed to be
stronger than the first impulse of nature.</p>
<p>Animals have not the affections which arise from reason, nor
can they do good, or acquire virtue.&nbsp; Every affection, and
impulse, which I have observed in them, are like our inferior
emotions, which do not depend entirely on our will, but are
involuntary; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>they seem to have been implanted to preserve the species,
and make the individual grateful for actual kindness.&nbsp; If
you caress and feed them, they will love you, as children do,
without knowing why; but we neither see imagination nor wisdom in
them; and, what principally exalts man, friendship and devotion,
they seem incapable of forming the least idea of.&nbsp;
Friendship is founded on knowledge and virtue, and these are
human acquirements; and devotion is a preparation for eternity;
because when we pray to God, we offer an affront to him, if we do
not strive to imitate the perfections He displays every where for
our imitation, that we may grow better and happier.</p>
<p>The children eagerly enquired in what manner they were to
behave, to prove that they were superior to animals?&nbsp; The
answer was short,&mdash;be tender-hearted; and let your superior
endowments ward off the evils which they cannot foresee.&nbsp; It
is only to animals that children <i>can</i> do good, men are
their superiors.&nbsp; When I was a child, added their tender
friend, I always made it my study and delight, to feed all the
dumb family that surrounded our house; and when I could be of use
to any one of them I was happy.&nbsp; This employment humanized
my heart, while, like wax, it took every impression; and
Providence has since made me an instrument of good&mdash;I have
been useful to my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I, who never wantonly
trod on an insect, or disregarded the plaint of the speechless
beast, can now give bread to the hungry, physic to the sick,
comfort to the afflicted, and, above all, am preparing you, who
are to live for ever, to be fit for the society of angels, and
good men made perfect.&nbsp; This world, I told you, was a road
to a better&mdash;a preparation for it; if we suffer, we grow
humbler and wiser: but animals have not this <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>advantage, and
man should not prevent their enjoying all the happiness of which
they are capable.</p>
<p>A she-cat or dog have such strong parental affection, that if
you take away their young, it almost kills them; some have
actually died of grief when all have been taken away; though they
do not seem to miss the greatest part.</p>
<p>A bitch had once all her litter stolen from her, and drowned
in a neighbouring brook: she sought them out, and brought them
one by one, laid them at the feet of her cruel master;&mdash;and
looking wistfully at them for some time, in dumb anguish, turning
her eyes on the destroyer, she expired!</p>
<p>I myself knew a man who had hardened his heart to such a
degree, that he found pleasure in tormenting every creature whom
he had any power over.&nbsp; I saw him let two guinea-pigs roll
down sloping tiles, to see if the fall would kill them.&nbsp; And
were they killed? cried Caroline.&nbsp; Certainly; and it is well
they were, or he would have found some other mode of
torment.&nbsp; When he became a father, he not only neglected to
educate his children, and set them a good example, but he taught
them to be cruel while he tormented them: the consequence was,
that they neglected him when he was old and feeble; and he died
in a ditch.</p>
<p>You may now go and feed your birds, and tie some of the
straggling flowers round the garden sticks.&nbsp; After dinner,
if the weather continues fine, we will walk to the wood, and I
will shew you the hole in the lime-stone mountain (a mountain
whose bowels, as we call them, are lime-stones) in which poor
crazy Robin and his dog lived.</p>
<h3><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The treatment of animals.&mdash;The story of
crazy Robin.&mdash;The man confined in the Bastille.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the children bounded over the short grass of
the common, and walked under the shadow of the mountain till they
came to a craggy part; where a stream broke out, and ran down the
declivity, struggling with the huge stones which impeded its
progress, and occasioned a noise that did not unpleasantly
interrupt the solemn silence of the place.&nbsp; The brook was
soon lost in a neighbouring wood, and the children turned their
eyes to the broken side of the mountain, over which ivy grew in
great profusion.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason pointed out a little cave, and
desired them to sit down on some stumps of trees, whilst she
related the promised story.</p>
<p>In yonder cave once lived a poor man, who generally went by
the name of crazy Robin.&nbsp; In his youth he was very
industrious, and married my father&rsquo;s dairy-maid; a girl
deserving of such a good husband.&nbsp; For some time they
continued to live very comfortably; their daily labour procured
their daily bread; but Robin, finding it was likely he should
have a large family, borrowed a trifle, to add to the small
pittance which they had saved in service, and took a little farm
in a neighbouring county.&nbsp; I was then a child.</p>
<p>Ten or twelve years after, I heard that a crazy man, who
appeared very harmless, had piled by the side of the brook a
great number of stones; he would wade into the river for them,
followed by a cur dog, whom he would frequently call his Jacky,
and even his Nancy; and then mumble to himself,&mdash;thou wilt
not leave me&mdash;we will dwell with the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>owls in the
ivy.&mdash;A number of owls had taken shelter in it.&nbsp; The
stones which he waded for he carried to the mouth of the hole,
and only just left room enough to creep in.&nbsp; Some of the
neighbours at last recollected his face; and I sent to enquire
what misfortune had reduced him to such a deplorable state.</p>
<p>The information I received from different persons, I will
communicate to you in as few words as I can.</p>
<p>Several of his children died in their infancy; and, two years
before he came to his native place, one misfortune had followed
another till he had sunk under their accumulated weight.&nbsp;
Through various accidents he was long in arrears to his landlord;
who, seeing that he was an honest man, who endeavoured to bring
up his family, did not distress him; but when his wife was
lying-in of her last child, the landlord dying, his heir sent and
seized the stock for the rent; and the person from whom he had
borrowed some money, exasperated to see all gone, arresting him
immediately, he was hurried to gaol, without being able to leave
any money for his family.&nbsp; The poor woman could not see them
starve, and trying to support her children before she had gained
sufficient strength, she caught cold; and through neglect, and
her want of proper nourishment, her illness turned to a putrid
fever; which two of the children caught from her, and died with
her.&nbsp; The two who were left, Jacky and Nancy, went to their
father, and took with them a cur dog, that had long shared their
frugal meals.</p>
<p>The children begged in the day, and at night slept with their
wretched father.&nbsp; Poverty and dirt soon robbed their cheeks
of the roses which the country air made bloom with a peculiar
freshness; so that they soon caught a jail fever,&mdash;and
died.&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>The poor father, who was now bereft of all his children,
hung over their bed in speechless anguish; not a groan or a tear
escaped from him, whilst he stood, two or three hours, in the
same attitude, looking at the dead bodies of his little
darlings.&nbsp; The dog licked his hands, and strove to attract
his attention; but for awhile he seemed not to observe his
caresses; when he did, he said, mournfully, thou wilt not leave
me&mdash;and then he began to laugh.&nbsp; The bodies were
removed; and he remained in an unsettled state, often frantic; at
length the phrenzy subsided, and he grew melancholy and
harmless.&nbsp; He was not then so closely watched; and one day
he contrived to make his escape, the dog followed him, and came
directly to his native village.</p>
<p>After I had received this account, I determined he should live
in the place he had chosen, undisturbed.&nbsp; I sent some
conveniences, all of which he rejected, except a mat; on which he
sometimes slept&mdash;the dog always did.&nbsp; I tried to induce
him to eat, but he constantly gave the dog whatever I sent him,
and lived on haws and blackberries, and every kind of
trash.&nbsp; I used to call frequently on him; and he sometimes
followed me to the house I now live in, and in winter he would
come of his own accord, and take a crust of bread.&nbsp; He
gathered water-cresses out of the pool, and would bring them to
me, with nosegays of wild thyme, which he plucked from the sides
of the mountain.&nbsp; I mentioned before, that the dog was a
cur.&nbsp; It had, indeed, the bad trick of a cur, and would run
barking after horses heels.&nbsp; One day, when his master was
gathering water-cresses, the dog running after a young
gentleman&rsquo;s horse, made it start, and almost threw the
rider; who grew so angry, that though he knew it was the poor
madman&rsquo;s dog, he levelled his gun at his <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>head&mdash;shot him,&mdash;and instantly rode off.&nbsp;
Robin ran to his dog,&mdash;he looked at his wounds, and not
sensible that he was dead, called to him to follow him; but when
he found that he could not, he took him to the pool, and washed
off the blood before it began to clot, and then brought him home,
and laid him on the mat.</p>
<p>I observed that I had not seen him pacing up the hills as
usual, and sent to enquire about him.&nbsp; He was found sitting
by the dog, and no entreaties could prevail on him to quit the
body, or receive any refreshment.&nbsp; I instantly set off for
this place, hoping, as I had always been a favourite, that I
should be able to persuade him to eat something.&nbsp; But when I
came to him, I found the hand of death was upon him.&nbsp; He was
still melancholy; yet there was not such a mixture of wildness in
it as formerly.&nbsp; I pressed him to take some food; but,
instead of answering me, or turning away, he burst into
tears,&mdash;a thing I had never seen him do before, and,
sobbing, he said, Will any one be kind to me!&mdash;you will kill
me!&mdash;I saw not my wife die&mdash;No!&mdash;they dragged me
from her&mdash;but I saw Jacky and Nancy die&mdash;and who pitied
me?&mdash;but my dog!&nbsp; He turned his eyes to the
body&mdash;I wept with him.&nbsp; He would then have taken some
nourishment, but nature was exhausted&mdash;and he expired.</p>
<p>Was that the cave? said Mary.&nbsp; They ran to it.&nbsp; Poor
Robin!&nbsp; Did you ever hear of any thing so cruel?&nbsp; Yes,
answered Mrs. Mason; and as we walk home I will relate an
instance of still greater barbarity.</p>
<p>I told you, that Robin was confined in a jail.&nbsp; In France
they have a dreadful one, called the Bastille.&nbsp; The poor
wretches who are confined in it live entirely alone; have not the
pleasure of seeing men or animals; nor are they allowed
books.&mdash;They live in <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>comfortless solitude.&nbsp; Some have
amused themselves by making figures on the wall; and others have
laid straws in rows.&nbsp; One miserable captive found a spider;
he nourished it for two or three years; it grew tame, and partook
of his lonely meal.&nbsp; The keeper observed it, and mentioned
the circumstance to a superiour, who ordered him to crush
it.&nbsp; In vain did the man beg to have his spider
spared.&nbsp; You find, Mary, that the nasty creature which you
despised was a comfort in solitude.&nbsp; The keeper obeyed the
cruel command; and the unhappy wretch felt more pain when he
heard the crush, than he had ever experienced during his long
confinement.&nbsp; He looked round a dreary apartment, and the
small portion of light which the grated bars admitted, only
served to shew him, that he breathed where nothing else drew
breath.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Anger.&mdash;History of Jane Fretful.</p>
<p>A few days after these walks and conversations, Mrs. Mason
heard a great noise in the play-room.&nbsp; She ran hastily to
enquire the cause, and found the children crying, and near them,
one of the young birds lying on the floor dead.&nbsp; With great
eagerness each of them tried, the moment she entered, to
exculpate herself, and prove that the other had killed the
bird.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason commanded them to be silent; and, at the
same time, called an orphan whom she had educated, and desired
her to take care of the nest.</p>
<p>The cause of the dispute was easily gathered from what they
both let fall.&nbsp; They had contested which had the best right
to feed the birds.&nbsp; Mary insisted <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>that she had a right, because she was
the eldest; and Caroline, because she took the nest.&nbsp;
Snatching it from one side of the room to the other, the bird
fell, and was trodden on before they were aware.</p>
<p>When they were a little composed, Mrs. Mason calmly thus
addressed them:&mdash;I perceive that you are ashamed of your
behaviour, and sorry for the consequence; I will not therefore
severely reprove you, nor add bitterness to the self-reproach you
must both feel,&mdash;because I pity you.&nbsp; You are now
inferiour to the animals that graze on the common; reason only
serves to render your folly more conspicuous and
inexcusable.&nbsp; Anger, is a little despicable vice: its
selfish emotions banish compassion, and undermine every
virtue.&nbsp; It is easy to conquer another; but noble to subdue
oneself.&nbsp; Had you, Mary, given way to your sister&rsquo;s
humour, you would have proved that you were not only older, but
wiser than her.&nbsp; And you, Caroline, would have saved your
charge, if you had, for the time, waved your right.</p>
<p>It is always a proof of superiour sense to bear with slight
inconveniences, and even trifling injuries, without complaining
or contesting about them.&nbsp; The soul reserves its firmness
for great occasions, and then it acts a decided part.&nbsp; It is
just the contrary mode of thinking, and the conduct produced by
it, which occasions all those trivial disputes that slowly
corrode domestic peace, and insensibly destroy what great
misfortunes could not sweep away.</p>
<p>I will tell you a story, that will take stronger hold on your
memory than mere remarks.</p>
<p>Jane Fretful was an only child.&nbsp; Her fond weak mother
would not allow her to be contradicted on any occasion.&nbsp; The
child had some tenderness of heart; but so accustomed was she to
see every thing give way to her humour, that she imagined the
world <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>was
only made for her.&nbsp; If any of her playfellows had toys, that
struck her capricious sickly fancy, she would cry for them; and
substitutes were in vain offered to quiet her, she must have the
identical ones, or fly into the most violent passion.&nbsp; When
she was an infant, if she fell down, her nurse made her beat the
floor.&nbsp; She continued the practice afterwards, and when she
was angry would kick the chairs and tables, or any senseless
piece of furniture, if they came in her way.&nbsp; I have seen
her throw her cap into the fire, because some of her acquaintance
had a prettier.</p>
<p>Continual passions weakened her constitution; beside, she
would not eat the common wholesome food that children, who are
subject to the small-pox and worms, ought to eat, and which is
necessary when they grow so fast, to make them strong and
handsome.&nbsp; Instead of being a comfort to her tender, though
mistaken, mother, she was her greatest torment.&nbsp; The
servants all disliked her; she loved no one but herself; and the
consequence was, she never inspired love; even the pity
good-natured people felt, was nearly allied to contempt.</p>
<p>A lady, who visited her mother, brought with her one day a
pretty little dog.&nbsp; Jane was delighted with it; and the
lady, with great reluctance, parted with it to oblige her
friend.&nbsp; For some time she fondled, and really felt
something like an affection for it: but, one day, it happened to
snatch a cake she was going to eat, and though there were twenty
within reach, she flew into a violent passion, and threw a stool
at the poor creature, who was big with pup.&nbsp; It fell down; I
can scarcely tell the rest; it received so severe a blow, that
all the young were killed, and the poor wretch languished two
days, suffering the most excruciating torture.</p>
<p>Jane Fretful, who was now angry with herself, sat <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>all the time
holding it, and every look the miserable animal gave her, stung
her to the heart.&nbsp; After its death she was very unhappy; but
did not try to conquer her temper.&nbsp; All the blessings of
life were thrown away on her; and, without any real misfortune,
she was continually miserable.</p>
<p>If she had planned a party of pleasure, and the weather proved
unfavourable, the whole day was spent in fruitless repining, or
venting her ill-humour on those who depended on her.&nbsp; If no
disappointment of that kind occurred, she could not enjoy the
promised pleasure; something always disconcerted her; the horses
went too fast, or, too slow; the dinner was ill-dressed, or, some
of the company contradicted her.</p>
<p>She was, when a child, very beautiful; but anger soon
distorted her regular features, and gave a forbidding fierceness
to her eyes.&nbsp; But if for a moment she looked pleased, she
still resembled a heap of combustible matter, to which an
accidental spark might set fire; of course quiet people were
afraid to converse with her.&nbsp; And if she ever did a good, or
a humane action, her ridiculous anger soon rendered it an
intolerable burden, if it did not entirely cancel it.</p>
<p>At last she broke her mother&rsquo;s heart, or hastened her
death, by her want of duty, and her many other faults: all
proceeding from violent, unrestrained anger.</p>
<p>The death of her mother, which affected her very much, left
her without a friend.&nbsp; She would sometimes say, Ah! my poor
mother, if you were now alive, I would not teaze you&mdash;I
would give the world to let you know that I am sorry for what I
have done: you died, thinking me ungrateful; and lamenting that I
did not die when you gave me suck.&nbsp; I shall never&mdash;oh!
never see you more.</p>
<p>This thought, and her peevish temper, preyed on <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>her impaired
constitution.&nbsp; She had not, by doing good, prepared her soul
for another state, or cherished any hopes that could disarm death
of its terrors, or render that last sleep sweet&mdash;its
approach was dreadful!&mdash;and she hastened her end, scolding
the physician for not curing her.&nbsp; Her lifeless countenance
displayed the marks of convulsive anger; and she left an ample
fortune behind her to those who did not regret her loss.&nbsp;
They followed her to the grave, on which no one shed a
tear.&nbsp; She was soon forgotten; and I only remember her, to
warn you to shun her errors.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Lying.&mdash;Honour.&mdash;Truth.&mdash;Small
Duties.&mdash;History of Lady Sly, and Mrs. Trueman.</p>
<p>The little girls were very assiduous to gain Mrs.
Mason&rsquo;s good opinion; and, by the mildness of their
behaviour, to prove to her that they were ashamed of
themselves.&nbsp; It was one of Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s rules, when
they offended her, that is, behaved improperly, to treat them
civilly; but to avoid giving them those marks of affection which
they were particularly delighted to receive.</p>
<p>Yesterday, said she to them, I only mentioned to you one
fault, though I observed two.&nbsp; You very readily guess I mean
the lie that you both told.&nbsp; Nay, look up, for I wish to see
you blush; and the confusion which I perceive in your faces gives
me pleasure; because it convinces me that it is not a confirmed
habit: and, indeed, my children, I should be sorry that such a
mean one had taken deep root in your infant minds.</p>
<p>When I speak of falsehood, I mean every kind; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>whatever
tends to deceive, though not said in direct terms.&nbsp; Tones of
voice, motions of the hand or head, if they make another believe
what they ought not to believe, are lies, and of the worst kind;
because the contrivance aggravates the guilt.&nbsp; I would much
sooner forgive a lie told directly, when perhaps fear entirely
occupied the thoughts, and the presence of God was not felt: for
it is His sacred Majesty that you affront by telling an
untruth.</p>
<p>How so? enquired Mary.</p>
<p>Because you hope to conceal your falsehood from every human
creature: but, if you consider a moment, you must recollect, that
the Searcher of hearts reads your very thoughts; that nothing is
hid from him.</p>
<p>You would blush if I were to discover that you told a lie; yet
wantonly forfeit the favour of Him, from whom you have received
life and all its blessings, to screen yourselves from correction
or reproof, or, what is still worse, to purchase some trifling
gratification, the pleasure of which would last but a moment.</p>
<p>You heard the gentleman who visited me this morning, very
frequently use the word Honour.&nbsp; Honour consists in
respecting yourself; in doing as you would be done by; and the
foundation of honour is Truth.</p>
<p>When I can depend on the veracity of people, that is to say,
am convinced that they adhere to truth, I rely on them; am
certain they have courage, because I know they will bear any
inconvenience rather than despise themselves, for telling a
lie.&nbsp; Besides, it is not necessary to consider what you
intend to say, when you have done right.&nbsp; Always determine,
on every occasion, to speak the truth, and you will never be at a
loss for words.&nbsp; If your character for this scrupulous
attention is <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>once fixed, your acquaintance will be courted; and those
who are not particularly pleased with you, will, at least,
respect your honourable principles.&nbsp; It is impossible to
form a friendship without making truth the basis; it is indeed
the essence of devotion, the employment of the understanding, and
the support of every duty.</p>
<p>I govern my servants, and you, by attending strictly to truth,
and this observance keeping my head clear and my heart pure, I am
ever ready to pray to the Author of good, the Fountain of
truth.</p>
<p>While I am discussing the subject, let me point out to you
another branch of this virtue; Sincerity.&mdash;And remember that
I every day set you an example; for I never, to please for the
moment, pay unmeaning compliments, or permit any words to drop
from my tongue, that my heart does not dictate.&nbsp; And when I
relate any matter of fact, I carefully avoid embellishing it, in
order to render it a more entertaining story; not that I think
such a practice absolutely criminal; but as it contributes
insensibly to wear away a respect for truth, I guard against the
vain impulse, lest I should lose the chief strength, and even
ornament, of my mind, and become like a wave of the sea, drifted
about by every gust of passion.</p>
<p>You must in life observe the most apparently insignificant
duties&mdash;the great ones are the pillars of virtue; but the
constant concurrence of trifling things, makes it necessary that
reason and conscience should always preside, to keep the heart
steady.&nbsp; Many people make promises, and appointments, which
they scruple not to break, if a more inviting pleasure occurs,
not remembering that the slightest duty should be performed
before a mere amusement is pursued&mdash;for any neglect of this
kind embitters <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>play.&nbsp; Nothing, believe me, can long be pleasant,
that is not innocent.</p>
<p>As I usually endeavour to recollect some persons of my
acquaintance, who have suffered by the faults, or follies, I wish
you to avoid; I will describe two characters, that will, if I
mistake not, very strongly enforce what I have been saying.</p>
<p>Last week you saw Lady Sly, who came to pay me a morning
visit.&nbsp; Did you ever see such a fine carriage, or such
beautiful horses?&nbsp; How they pawed the ground, and displayed
their rich harnesses!&nbsp; Her servants wore elegant liveries,
and her own clothes suited the equipage.&nbsp; Her house is equal
to her carriage; the rooms are lofty, and hung with silk; noble
glasses and pictures adorn them: and the pleasure-grounds are
large and well laid out; beside the trees and shrubs, they
contain a variety of summer-houses and temples, as they are
called.&mdash;Yet my young friends, this is <i>state</i>, not
<i>dignity</i>.</p>
<p>This woman has a little soul, she never attended to truth, and
obtaining great part of her fortune by falsehood, it has blighted
all her enjoyments.&nbsp; She inhabits that superb house, wears
the gayest clothes, and rides in that beautiful carriage, without
feeling pleasure.&nbsp; Suspicion, and the cares it has given
birth to, have wrinkled her countenance, and banished every trace
of beauty, which paint in vain endeavours to repair.&nbsp; Her
suspicious temper arises from a knowledge of her own heart, and
the want of rational employments.</p>
<p>She imagines that every person she converses with means to
deceive her; and when she leaves a company, supposes all the ill
they may say of her, because she recollects her own
practice.&nbsp; She listens about her house, expecting to
discover the designs of her servants, none of whom she can trust;
and in <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>consequence of this anxiety her sleep is unsound, and
her food tasteless.&nbsp; She walks in her paradise of a garden,
and smells not the flowers, nor do the birds inspire her with
cheerfulness.&mdash;These pleasures are true and simple, they
lead to the love of God, and all the creatures whom He hath
made&mdash;and cannot warm a heart which a malicious story can
please.</p>
<p>She cannot pray to God;&mdash;He hates a liar!&nbsp; She is
neglected by her husband, whose only motive for marrying her was
to clear an incumbered estate.&nbsp; Her son, her only child, is
undutiful; the poor never have cause to bless her; nor does she
contribute to the happiness of any human being.</p>
<p>To kill time, and drive away the pangs of remorse, she goes
from one house to another, collecting and propagating scandalous
tales, to bring others on a level with herself.&nbsp; Even those
who resemble her are afraid of her; she lives alone in the world,
its good things are poisoned by her vices, and neither inspire
joy nor gratitude.</p>
<p>Before I tell you how she acquired these vicious habits, and
enlarged her fortune by disregarding truth, I must desire you to
think of Mrs. Trueman, the curate&rsquo;s wife, who lives in
yonder white house, close to the church; it is a small one, yet
the woodbines and jessamins that twine about the windows give it
a pretty appearance.&nbsp; Her voice is sweet, her manners not
only easy, but elegant; and her simple dress makes her person
appear to the greatest advantage.</p>
<p>She walks to visit me, and her little ones hang on her hands,
and cling to her clothes, they are so fond of her.&nbsp; If any
thing terrifies them, they run under her apron, and she looks
like the hen taking care of her young brood.&nbsp; The domestic
animals play with the children, finding her a mild attentive <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>mistress; and
out of her scanty fortune she contrives to feed and clothe many a
hungry shivering wretch; who bless her as she passes along.</p>
<p>Though she has not any outward decorations, she appears
superior to her neighbours, who call her the <i>Gentlewoman</i>;
indeed every gesture shews an accomplished and dignified mind,
that relies on itself; when deprived of the fortune which
contributed to polish and give it consequence.</p>
<p>Drawings, the amusement of her youth, ornament her neat
parlour; some musical instruments stand in one corner; for she
plays with taste, and sings sweetly.</p>
<p>All the furniture, not forgetting a book-case, full of
well-chosen books, speak the refinement of the owner, and the
pleasures a cultivated mind has within its own grasp, independent
of prosperity.</p>
<p>Her husband, a man of taste and learning, reads to her, while
she makes clothes for her children, whom she teaches in the
tenderest, and most persuasive manner, important truths and
elegant accomplishments.</p>
<p>When you have behaved well for some time you shall visit her,
and ramble in her little garden; there are several pretty seats
in it, and the nightingales warble their sweetest songs,
undisturbed, in the shade.</p>
<p>I have now given you an account of the present situation of
both, and of their characters; listen to me whilst I relate in
what manner these characters were formed, and the consequence of
each adhering to a different mode of conduct.</p>
<p>Lady Sly, when she was a child, used to say pert things, which
the injudicious people about her laughed at, and called very
witty.&nbsp; Finding that her prattle pleased, she talked
incessantly, and invented stories, when adding to those that had
some <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>foundation, was not sufficient to entertain the
company.&nbsp; If she stole sweetmeats, or broke any thing, the
cat, or the dog, was blamed, and the poor animals were corrected
for her faults; nay, sometimes the servants lost their places in
consequence of her assertions.&nbsp; Her parents died and left
her a large fortune, and an aunt, who had a still larger, adopted
her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Trueman, her cousin, was, some years after, adopted by
the same lady; but her parents could not leave their estate to
her, as it descended to the male heir.&nbsp; She had received the
most liberal education, and was in every respect the reverse of
her cousin; who envied her merit, and could not bear to think of
her dividing the fortune which she had long expected to inherit
entirely herself.&nbsp; She therefore practised every mean art to
prejudice her aunt against her, and succeeded.</p>
<p>A faithful old servant endeavoured to open her
mistress&rsquo;s eyes; but the cunning niece contrived to invent
the most infamous story of the old domestic, who was in
consequence of it dismissed.&nbsp; Mrs. Trueman supported her,
when she could not succeed in vindicating her, and suffered for
her generosity; for her aunt dying soon after, left only five
hundred pounds to this amiable woman, and fifty thousand to Lady
Sly.</p>
<p>They both of them married shortly after.&nbsp; One, the
profligate Lord Sly, and the other a respectable clergyman, who
had been disappointed in his hopes of preferment.&nbsp; This last
couple, in spite of their mutual disappointments, are contented
with their lot; and are preparing themselves and children for
another world, where truth, virtue and happiness dwell
together.</p>
<p>For believe me, whatever happiness we attain in this life,
must faintly resemble what God Himself <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>enjoys, whose truth and goodness
produce a sublime degree, such as we cannot conceive, it is so
far above our limited capacities.</p>
<p>I did not intend to detain you so long, said Mrs. Mason; have
you finished <i>Mrs. Trimmer&rsquo;s Fabulous
Histories</i>?&nbsp; Indeed we have, answered Caroline,
mournfully, and I was very sorry to come to the end.&nbsp; I
never read such a pretty book; may I read it over again to Mrs.
Trueman&rsquo;s little Fanny?&nbsp; Certainly, said Mrs. Mason,
if you can make her understand that birds never talk.&nbsp; Go
and run about the garden, and remember the next lie I detect, I
shall punish; because lying is a vice;&mdash;and I ought to
punish you if you are guilty of it, to prevent your feeling Lady
Sly&rsquo;s misery.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Anger.&mdash;Folly produces Self-contempt, and
the Neglect of others.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason had a number of visitors one afternoon, who
conversed in the usual thoughtless manner which people often fall
into who do not consider before they speak; they talked of
Caroline&rsquo;s beauty, and she gave herself many affected airs
to make it appear to the best advantage.&nbsp; But Mary, who had
not a face to be proud of, was observing some peculiarities in
the dress or manners of the guests; and one very respectable old
lady, who had lost her teeth, afforded her more diversion than
any of the rest.</p>
<p>The children went to bed without being reproved, though Mrs.
Mason, when she dismissed them, said gravely, I give you to-night
a kiss of peace, an affectionate one you have not deserved.&nbsp;
They therefore discovered by her behaviour that they had done <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>wrong, and
waited for an explanation to regain her favour.</p>
<p>She was never in a passion, but her quiet steady displeasure
made them feel so little in their own eyes, they wished her to
smile that they might be something; for all their consequence
seemed to arise from her approbation.&nbsp; I declare, said
Caroline, I do not know what I have done, and yet I am sure I
never knew Mrs. Mason find fault without convincing me that I had
done wrong.&nbsp; Did you, Mary, ever see her in a passion?&nbsp;
No, said Mary, I do believe that she was never angry in her life;
when John threw down all the china, and stood trembling, she was
the first to say that the carpet made him stumble.&nbsp; Yes, now
I do remember, when we first came to her house, John forgot to
bring the cow and her young calf into the cow-house; I heard her
bid him do it directly, and the poor calf was almost frozen to
death&mdash;she spoke then in a hurry, and seemed angry.&nbsp;
Now you mention it, I do recollect, replied Caroline, that she
was angry, when Betty did not carry the poor sick woman the broth
she ordered her to take to her.&nbsp; But this is not like the
passion I used to see nurse in, when any thing vexed her.&nbsp;
She would scold us, and beat the girl who waited on her.&nbsp;
Poor little Jenny, many a time was she beaten, when we vexed
nurse; I would tell her she was &lt;not&gt; to blame now if I saw
her&mdash;and I would not tease her any more.</p>
<p>I declare I cannot go to sleep, said Mary, I am afraid of Mrs.
Mason&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;would you think, Caroline, that she who
looks so very good-natured sometimes, could frighten one
so?&nbsp; I wish I were as wise and as good as she is.&nbsp; The
poor woman with the six children, whom we met on the common, said
she was an angel, and that she had saved her&rsquo;s and her
children&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; My heart is in my mouth, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>indeed,
replied Caroline, when I think of to-morrow morning, and yet I am
much happier than I was when we were at home.&nbsp; I cried, I
cannot now tell for what, all day; I never wished to be
good&mdash;nobody told me what it was to be good.&nbsp; I wish to
be a woman, said Mary, and to be like Mrs. Mason, or Mrs.
Trueman,&mdash;we are to go to see her if we behave well.</p>
<p>Sleep soon over-powered them, and they forgot their
apprehensions.&nbsp; In the morning they awoke refreshed, and
took care to learn their lessons, and feed the chickens, before
Mrs. Mason left her chamber.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Virtue the Soul of Beauty.&mdash;The Tulip and
the Rose.&mdash;The Nightingale.&mdash;External
Ornaments.&mdash;Characters.</p>
<p>The next morning Mrs. Mason met them first in the garden; and
she desired Caroline to look at a bed of tulips, that were then
in their highest state of perfection.&nbsp; I, added she, choose
to have every kind of flower in my garden, as the succession
enables me to vary my daily prospect, and gives it the charm of
variety; yet these tulips afford me less pleasure than most of
the other sort which I cultivate&mdash;and I will tell you
why&mdash;they are only beautiful.&nbsp; Listen to my
distinction;&mdash;good features, and a fine complexion, I term
<i>bodily</i> beauty.&nbsp; Like the streaks in the tulip, they
please the eye for a moment; but this uniformity soon tires, and
the active mind flies off to something else.&nbsp; The soul of
beauty, my dear children, consists in the body gracefully
exhibiting the emotions and variations of the informing
mind.&nbsp; If truth, humanity, and knowledge inhabit the breast,
the eyes will beam with a mild lustre, modesty will suffuse the
cheeks, and smiles of innocent joy play over all the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>features.&nbsp; At first sight, regularity and colour
will attract, and have the advantage, because the hidden springs
are not directly set in motion; but when internal goodness is
reflected, every other kind of beauty, the shadow of it, withers
away before it&mdash;as the sun obscures a lamp.</p>
<p>You are certainly handsome, Caroline; I mean, have good
features; but you must improve your mind to give them a pleasing
expression, or they will only serve to lead your understanding
astray.&nbsp; I have seen some foolish people take great pains to
decorate the outside of their houses, to attract the notice of
strangers, who gazed, and passed on; whilst the inside, where
they received their friends, was dark and inconvenient.&nbsp;
Apply this observation to mere personal attractions.&nbsp; They
may, it is true, for a few years, charm the superficial part of
your acquaintance, whose notions of beauty are not built on any
principle of utility.&nbsp; Such persons might look at you, as
they would glance their eye over these tulips, and feel for a
moment the same pleasure that a view of the variegated rays of
light would convey to an uninformed mind.&nbsp; The lower class
of mankind, and children, are fond of finery; gaudy, dazzling
appearances catch their attention; but the discriminating
judgment of a person of sense requires, besides colour, order,
proportion, grace and usefulness, to render the idea of beauty
complete.</p>
<p>Observe that rose, it has all the perfections I speak of;
colour, grace, and sweetness&mdash;and even when the fine tints
fade, the smell is grateful to those who have before contemplated
its beauties.&nbsp; I have only one bed of tulips, though my
garden is large, but, in every part of it, roses attract the
eye.</p>
<p>You have seen Mrs. Trueman, and think her a very fine woman;
yet her skin and complexion have only <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the clearness that temperance gives;
and her features, strictly speaking, are not regular: Betty, the
housemaid, has, in both these respects, much the superiority over
her.&nbsp; But, though it is not easy to define in what her
beauty consists, the eye follows her whenever she moves; and
every person of taste listens for the modulated sounds which
proceed out of her mouth, to be improved and pleased.&nbsp; It is
conscious worth, <i>truth</i>, that gives dignity to her walk,
and simple elegance to her conversation.&nbsp; She has, indeed, a
most excellent understanding, and a feeling heart; sagacity and
tenderness, the result of both, are happily blended in her
countenance; and taste is the polish, which makes them appear to
the best advantage.&nbsp; She is more than beautiful; and you see
her varied excellencies again and again, with increasing
pleasure.&nbsp; They are not obtruded on you, for knowledge has
taught her true humility: she is not like the flaunting tulip,
that forces itself forward into notice; but resembles the modest
rose, you see yonder, retiring under its elegant foliage.</p>
<p>I have mentioned flowers&mdash;the same order is observed in
the higher departments of nature.&nbsp; Think of the birds; those
that sing best have not the finest plumage; indeed just the
contrary; God divides His gifts, and amongst the feathered race
the nightingale (sweetest of warblers, who pours forth her varied
strain when sober eve comes on) you would seek in vain in the
morning, if you expected that beautiful feathers should point out
the songstress: many who incessantly twitter, and are only
tolerable in the general concert, would surpass her, and attract
your attention.</p>
<p>I knew, some time before you were born, a very fine, a very
handsome girl; I saw she had abilities, and I saw with pain that
she attended to the most obvious, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>but least valuable gift of
heaven.&nbsp; Her ingenuity slept, whilst she tried to render her
person more alluring.&nbsp; At last she caught the
small-pox&mdash;her beauty vanished, and she was for a time
miserable; but the natural vivacity of youth overcame her
unpleasant feelings.&nbsp; In consequence of the disorder, her
eyes became so weak that she was obliged to sit in a dark
room.&nbsp; To beguile the tedious day she applied to music, and
made a surprising proficiency.&nbsp; She even began to think, in
her retirement, and when she recovered her sight grew fond of
reading.</p>
<p>Large companies did not now amuse her, she was no longer the
object of admiration, or if she was taken notice of, it was to be
pitied, to hear her former self praised, and to hear them lament
the depredation that dreadful disease had made in a fine
face.&nbsp; Not expecting or wishing to be observed, she lost her
affected airs, and attended to the conversation, in which she was
soon able to bear a part.&nbsp; In short, the desire of pleasing
took a different turn, and as she improved her mind, she
discovered that virtue, internal beauty, was valuable on its own
account, and not like that of the person, which resembles a toy,
that pleases the observer, but does not render the possessor
happy.</p>
<p>She found, that in acquiring knowledge, her mind grew
tranquil, and the noble desire of acting conformably to the will
of God succeeded, and drove out the immoderate vanity which
before actuated her, when her equals were the objects she thought
most of, and whose approbation she sought with such
eagerness.&nbsp; And what had she sought?&nbsp; To be stared at
and called handsome.&nbsp; Her beauty, the mere sight of it, did
not make others good, or comfort the afflicted; but after she had
lost it, she was comfortable herself, and set her friends the
most useful example.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The
money that she had formerly appropriated to ornament her person,
now clothed the naked; yet she really appeared better dressed, as
she had acquired the habit of employing her time to the best
advantage, and could make many things herself.&nbsp; Besides, she
did not implicitly follow the reigning fashion, for she had
learned to distinguish, and in the most trivial matters acted
according to the dictates of good sense.</p>
<p>The children made some comments on this story, but the
entrance of a visitor interrupted the conversation, and they ran
about the garden, comparing the roses and tulips.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Summer Evening&rsquo;s Amusement.&mdash;The
Arrival of a Family of Haymakers.&mdash;Ridicule of personal
Defects censured.&mdash;A Storm.&mdash;The Fear of
Death.&mdash;The Cottage of honest Jack, the shipwrecked
Sailor.&mdash;The History of Jack, and his faithful Dog
Pompey.</p>
<p>The evening was pleasant; Mrs. Mason and the children walked
out; and many rustic noises struck their ears.&nbsp; Some bells
in a neighbouring village, softened by the distance, sounded
pleasingly; the beetles hummed, and the children pursued them,
not to destroy them; but to observe their form, and ask questions
concerning their mode of living.&nbsp; Sheep were bleating and
cattle lowing, the rivulet near them babbled along, while the
sound of the distant ocean died away on the ear&mdash;or they
forgot it, listening to the whistling of the hay-makers, who were
returning from the field.&nbsp; They met a whole family who came
every year from another county where they could not find constant
employment, and <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Mrs. Mason allowed them to sleep in her barn.&nbsp; The
little ones knew their benefactress, and tried to catch a smile;
and she was ever ready to smile on those whom she obliged; for
she loved all her fellow creatures, and love lightens
obligations.&nbsp; Besides, she thought that the poor who are
willing to work, had a right to the comforts of life.</p>
<p>A few moments after, they met a deformed woman; the children
stared her almost out of countenance; but Mrs. Mason turned her
head another way, and when the poor object was out of hearing,
said to Mary, I intended to reprove you this morning for a fault
which I have frequently seen you commit; and this moment and the
other evening it was particularly conspicuous.&nbsp; When that
deformed woman passed us, I involuntarily looked at something
else, and would not let her perceive that she was a disgusting
figure, and attracted notice on that account.&nbsp; I say I did
it involuntarily, for I have accustomed myself to think of
others, and what they will suffer on all occasions: and this
lothness to offend, or even to hurt the feelings of another, is
an instantaneous spring which actuates my conduct, and makes me
kindly affected to every thing that breathes.&nbsp; If I then am
so careful not to wound a stranger, what shall I think of your
behaviour, Mary? when you laughed at a respectable old woman, who
beside her virtues and her age, had been particularly civil to
you.&nbsp; I have always seen persons of the weakest
understandings, and whose hearts benevolence seldom touched,
ridicule bodily infirmities, and accidental defects.&nbsp; They
could only relish the inferiour kind of beauty, which I described
this morning, and a silly joy has elated their empty souls, on
finding, by comparison, that they were superiour to others in
that respect, though the <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>conclusion was erroneous, for merit,
mental acquirements, can only give a just claim to
superiority.&nbsp; Had you possessed the smallest portion of
discernment, you would soon have forgotten the tones, loss of
teeth made drawling, in listening to the chearful good sense
which that worthy woman&rsquo;s words conveyed.&nbsp; You
laughed, because you were ignorant, and I now excuse you; but
some years hence, if I were to see you in company, with such a
propensity, I should still think you a child, an overgrown one,
whose mind did not expand as the body grew.</p>
<p>The sky began to thicken, and the lowing of the cattle to have
a melancholy cadence; the nightingale forgot her song, and fled
to her nest; and the sea roared and lashed the rocks.&nbsp;
During the calm which portended an approaching storm, every
creature was running for shelter.&mdash;We must, if possible,
said Mrs. Mason, reach yon cottage on the cliff, for we shall
soon have a violent thunder-storm.&nbsp; They quickened their
pace, but the hurricane overtook them.&nbsp; The hail-stones
fell, the clouds seemed to open and disclose the lightning, while
loud peals of thunder shook the ground; the wind also in violent
gusts rushed among the trees, tore off the slender branches and
loosened the roots.</p>
<p>The children were terrified; but Mrs. Mason gave them each a
hand, and chatted with them to dispel their fears.&nbsp; She
informed them that storms were necessary to dissipate noxious
vapours, and to answer many other purposes, which were not,
perhaps, obvious to our weak understandings.&nbsp; But are you
not afraid? cried the trembling Caroline.&nbsp; No, certainly, I
am not afraid.&mdash;I walk with the same security as when the
sun enlivened the prospect&mdash;God is still present, and we are
safe.&nbsp; Should the <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>flash that passes by us, strike me
dead, it cannot hurt me, I fear not death!&mdash;I only fear that
Being who can render death terrible, on whose providence I calmly
rest; and my confidence earthly sorrows cannot destroy.&nbsp; A
mind is never truly great, till the love of virtue overcomes the
fear of death.</p>
<p>By this time they had mounted the cliff, and saw the
tumultuous deep.&nbsp; The angry billows rose, and dashed against
the shore; and the loud noise of the raging sea resounded from
rock to rock.</p>
<p>They ran into the cottage; the poor woman who lived in it,
sent her children for wood, and soon made a good fire to dry
them.</p>
<p>The father of the family soon after came in, leaning on
crutches; and over one eye there was a large patch.&nbsp; I am
glad to see you honest Jack, said Mrs. Mason, come and take your
seat by the fire, and tell the children the story of your
shipwreck.</p>
<p>He instantly complied.&nbsp; I was very young, my dear ladies,
said Jack, when I went to sea, and endured many
hardships,&mdash;however I made a shift to weather them all; and
whether the wind was fair or foul, I ran up the shrouds and sung
at the helm.&nbsp; I had always a good heart, no lad fore or aft
had a better; when we were at sea, I never was the first to
flinch; and on shore I was as merry as the best of them.&nbsp; I
married she you see yonder, (lifting his crutch to point to his
wife) and her work and my wages did together, till I was
shipwrecked on these rocks.&nbsp; Oh! it was a dreadful night;
this is nothing to it; but I am getting to the end of my story
before I begin it.</p>
<p>During the war, I went once or twice to New York.&nbsp; The
last was a good voyage, and we were all returning with joy to
dear England, when the storm rose; the vessel was like a bird, it
flew up and down, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>and several of our best hands were washed clean
overboard&mdash;My poor captain! a better never plowed the ocean,
he fell overboard too, and it was some time before we missed him;
for it was quite dark, except that flashes of lightning, now and
then, gave us light.&nbsp; I was at the helm, lashing it to the
side of the ship&mdash;a dreadful flash came across me, and I
lost one of my precious eyes.&mdash;But thank God I have one
left.</p>
<p>The weather cleared up next day, and, though we had been
finely mauled, I began to hope, for I hate to be faint-hearted,
and certainly we should have got into the channel very soon, if
we had not fell in with a French man of war, which took us; for
we could not make any resistance.</p>
<p>I had a dog, poor Pompey! with me.&nbsp; Pompey would not
leave me, he was as fond of me as if he had been a
christian.&nbsp; I had lost one eye by the lightning, the other
had been sore, so that I could hardly call it a peep-hole.&nbsp;
Somehow I fell down the hatchway, and bruised one of my legs; but
I did not mind it, do ye see, till we arrived at Brest and were
thrown into a French Prison.</p>
<p>There I was worse off than ever; the room we were all stowed
in, was full of vermin, and our food very bad; mouldy biscuits,
and salt fish.&nbsp; The prison was choke full, and many a
morning did we find some honest fellow with his chops
fallen&mdash;he was not to be waked any more!&mdash;he was gone
to the other country, do ye see.</p>
<p>Yet the French have not such hard hearts as people say they
have!&nbsp; Several women brought us broth, and wine; and one
gave me some rags to wrap round my leg, it was very painful, I
could not clean it, nor had I any plaister.&nbsp; One day I was
looking sorrowfully at it, thinking for certain I should <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>lose my
precious limb; when, would you believe it? Pompey saw what I was
thinking about, and began to lick it.&mdash;And, I never knew
such a surprizing thing, it grew better and better every day, and
at last was healed without any plaister.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p36.jpg">
<img alt=
"Indeed we are very happy!"
title=
"Indeed we are very happy!"
src="images/p36.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After that I was very sick, and the same tender-hearted
creature who gave me the rags, took me to her house; and fresh
air soon recovered me.&nbsp; I for certain ought to speak well of
the French; but for their kindness I should have been in another
port by this time.&nbsp; Mayhap I might have gone with a fair
wind, yet I should have been sorry to have left my poor wife and
her children.&nbsp; But I am letting all my line run out!&nbsp;
Well, by-and-by, there was an exchange of prisoners, and we were
once more in an English vessel, and I made sure of seeing my
family again; but the weather was still foul.&nbsp; Three days
and nights we were in the greatest distress; and the fourth the
ship was dashed against these rocks.&nbsp; Oh! if you had heard
the crash!&nbsp; The water rushed in&mdash;the men screamed, Lord
have mercy on us!&nbsp; There was a woman in the ship, and, as I
could swim, I tried to save her, and Pompey followed me; but I
lost him&mdash;poor fellow!&nbsp; I declare I cried like a child
when I saw his dead body.&nbsp; However I brought the woman to
shore; and assisted some more of my mess-mates; but, standing in
the water so long, I lost the use of my limbs&mdash;yet Heaven
was good to me; Madam, there, sent a cart for us all, and took
care of us; but I never recovered the use of my limbs.&nbsp; So
she asked me all about my misfortunes, and sent for wife, who
came directly, and we have lived here ever since.&nbsp; We catch
fish for Madam, and watch for a storm, hoping some time or other
to be as kind to a poor perishing soul as she has been to
me.&nbsp; Indeed we are very happy&mdash;I might now <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>have been
begging about the streets, but for Madam, God bless her.</p>
<p>A tear strayed down Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s cheek, while a smile of
benevolence lighted up her countenance&mdash;the little girls
caught each hand&mdash;They were all silent a few minutes when
she, willing to turn the discourse, enquired whether they had any
fish in the house?&nbsp; Some were produced, they were quickly
dressed, and they all eat together.&nbsp; They had a chearful
meal, and honest Jack sung some of his seafaring songs, and did
all he could to divert them and express his gratitude.&nbsp;
Getting up to reach the brown loaf, he limped very awkwardly,
Mary was just beginning to laugh, when she restrained herself;
for she recollected that his awkwardness made him truly
respectable, because he had lost the use of his limbs when he was
doing good, saving the lives of his fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>The weather cleared up, and they returned home.&nbsp; The
children conversed gaily with each other all the way home,
talking of the poor sailor, and his faithful dog.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The Inconveniences of immoderate
Indulgence.</p>
<p>The children were allowed to help themselves to fruit, when it
made a part of their meal; and Caroline always took care to pick
out the best, or swallow what she took in a hurry, lest she
should not get as much as she wished for.&nbsp; Indeed she
generally eat more than her share.&nbsp; She had several times
eaten more than a person ought to eat at one time, without
feeling any ill effects; but one afternoon she complained of a
pain in her stomach in consequence <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of it, and her pale face, and languid
eyes, plainly shewed her indisposition.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason gave her
an emetic, and after the operation she was obliged to go to bed,
though she had promised herself a pleasant walk that
evening.&nbsp; She was left alone, for Mary was not permitted to
stay at home with her, as she offered to do.&nbsp; Had her
sickness been accidental, we would both have tried to amuse her,
said Mrs. Mason; but her greediness now receiving its natural and
just punishment, she must endure it without the alleviation which
pity affords; only tell her from me, that the pleasure was but
momentary, while the pain and confinement it produced, has
already lasted some hours.</p>
<p>The next morning, though scarcely recovered, she got up, as
usual, to have a walk before breakfast.&nbsp; During these walks,
Mrs. Mason told them stories, pointed out the wisdom of God in
the creation, and took them to visit her poor tenants.&nbsp;
These visits not only enabled her to form a judgment of their
wants, but made them very industrious; for they were all anxious
that she might find their houses and persons clean.&nbsp; And
returning through the farmyard, Mrs. Mason stopped according to
custom, to see whether the poor animals were taken care
of&mdash;this she called earning her breakfast.&nbsp; The servant
was just feeding the pigs, and though she poured a great quantity
into the trough, the greedy creatures tried to gobble it up from
one another.&nbsp; Caroline blushed, she saw this sight was meant
for her, and she felt ashamed of her gluttony.&nbsp; But Mrs.
Mason, willing to impress her still more strongly, thus addressed
her.</p>
<p>Providence, my child, has given us passions and appetites for
various purposes&mdash;two are generally obvious, I will point
them out to you.&nbsp; First to <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>render our present life more
comfortable, and then to prepare us for another, by making us
sociable beings; as in society virtue is acquired, and
self-denial practised.&nbsp; A moderate quantity of proper food
recruits our exhausted spirits, and invigorates the animal
functions; but, if we exceed moderation, the mind will be
oppressed, and soon become the slave of the body, or both grow
listless and inactive.&nbsp; Employed various ways, families meet
at meals, and there giving up to each other, learn in the most
easy, pleasant way to govern their appetites.&nbsp; Pigs, you
see, devour what they can get; but men, if they have any
affections, love their fellow-creatures, and wish for a return;
nor will they, for the sake of a brutish gratification, lose the
esteem of those they value.&nbsp; Besides, no one can be reckoned
virtuous who has not learned to bear poverty: yet those who think
much of gratifying their appetites, will at last act meanly in
order to indulge them.&nbsp; But when any employment of the
understanding, or strong affection occupies the mind, eating is
seldom thought a matter of greater importance than it ought to
be.&nbsp; Let the idle <i>think</i> of their meals; but do you
employ the intermediate time in a different manner, and only
enjoy them when you join the social circle.&nbsp; I like to see
children, and even men, eat chearfully, and gratefully receive
the blessings sent by Heaven; yet I would not have them abuse
those blessings, or ever let the care necessary to support the
body, injure the immortal spirit: many think of the sustenance
the former craves, and entirely neglect the latter.</p>
<p>I remarked to you before, that in the most apparently trivial
concerns, we are to do as we would be done by.&nbsp; This duty
must be practised constantly; at meals there are frequent
opportunities, and I hope, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Caroline, I shall never again see you
eager to secure dainties for yourself.&nbsp; If such a
disposition were to grow up with you, you ought to live alone,
for no one should enjoy the advantages and pleasures which arise
from social intercourse, who is unwilling to give way to the
inclinations of others, and allow each their share of the good
things of this life.</p>
<p>You experienced yesterday, that pain follows immoderate
indulgence; it is always the case, though sometimes not felt so
immediately; but the constitution is insensibly destroyed, and
old age will come on, loaded with infirmities.&nbsp; You also
lost a very pleasant walk, and some fine fruit.&nbsp; We visited
Mrs. Goodwin&rsquo;s garden, and as Mary had before convinced me
that she could regulate her appetites, I gave her leave to pluck
as much fruit as she wished; and she did not abuse my
indulgence.&nbsp; On the contrary, she spent most part of the
time in gathering some for me, and her attention made it taste
sweeter.</p>
<p>Coming home I called her my friend, and she deserved the name,
for she was no longer a child; a reasonable affection had
conquered an appetite; her understanding took the lead, and she
had practised a virtue.</p>
<p>The subject was now dropped; but, Caroline determined to copy
in future her sister&rsquo;s temperance and self-denial.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The Danger of Delay.&mdash;Description of a
Mansion-house in Ruins.&mdash;The History of Charles Townley.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason who always regulated her own time, and never
loitered her hours irresolutely away, had very frequently to wait
for the children, when she <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>wished to walk, though she had
desired them to be ready at a precise time.&nbsp; Mary in
particular had a trick of putting everything off till the last
moment, and then she did but half do it, or left it undone.&nbsp;
This indolent way of delaying made her miss many opportunities of
obliging and doing good; and whole hours were lost in thoughtless
idleness, which she afterwards wished had been better
employed.</p>
<p>This was the case one day, when she had a letter to write to
her father; and though it was mentioned to her early in the
morning, the finest part of the evening slipped away whilst she
was finishing it; and her haste made her forget the principal
thing which she intended to have said.</p>
<p>Out of breath she joined them; and after they had crossed
several fields, Mrs. Mason turning down a long avenue, bade them
look at a large old mansion-house.&nbsp; It was now in
ruins.&nbsp; Ivy grew over the substantial walls, that still
resisted the depredations of time, and almost concealed a noble
arch, on which maimed lions couched; and vultures and eagles, who
had lost their wings, seemed to rest for ever there.&nbsp; Near
it was a rookery, and the rooks lived safe in the high trees,
whose trunks were all covered with ivy or moss, and a number of
fungusses grew about their large roots.&nbsp; The grass was long,
and remaining undisturbed, save when the wind swept across it,
was of course pathless.&nbsp; Here the mower never whet his
scythe, nor did the haymakers mix their songs with the hoarse
croaking of the rooks.&nbsp; A spacious basin, on the margin of
which water plants grew with wild luxuriance, was overspread with
slime; and afforded a shelter for toads and adders.&nbsp; In many
places were heaped the ruins of ornamental buildings, whilst
sun-dials rested in the shade;&mdash;and pedestals that had
crushed the <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>figures they before supported.&nbsp; Making their way
through the grass, they would frequently stumble over a headless
statue, or the head would impede their progress.&nbsp; When they
spoke, the sound seemed to return again, as if unable to
penetrate the thick stagnated air.&nbsp; The sun could not dart
its purifying rays through the thick gloom, and the fallen leaves
contributed to choke up the way, and render the air more
noxious.</p>
<p>I brought you to this place on purpose this evening, said Mrs.
Mason to the children, who clung about her, to tell you the
history of the last inhabitant; but, as this part is unwholesome,
we will sit on the broken stones of the drawbridge.</p>
<p>Charles Townley was a boy of uncommon abilities, and strong
feelings; but he ever permitted those feelings to direct his
conduct, without submitting to the direction of reason; I mean,
the present emotion governed him.&mdash;He had not any strength
or consistency of character; one moment he enjoyed a pleasure,
and the next felt the pangs of remorse, on account of some duty
which he had neglected.&nbsp; He always indeed intended to act
right in every particular <i>to-morrow</i>; but <i>to-day</i> he
followed the prevailing whim.</p>
<p>He heard by chance of a man in great distress, he determined
to relieve him, and left his house in order to follow the humane
impulse; but meeting an acquaintance, he was persuaded to go to
the play, and <i>to-morrow</i>, he thought, he would do the act
of charity.&nbsp; The next morning some company came to breakfast
with him, and took him with them to view some fine
pictures.&nbsp; In the evening he went to a concert; the day
following he was tired, and laid in bed till noon; then read a
pathetic story, well wrought up, <i>wept</i> over it&mdash;fell
asleep&mdash;and forgot to <i>act</i> humanely.&nbsp; <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>An accident
reminded him of his intention, he sent to the man, and found that
he had too long delayed&mdash;the relief was useless.</p>
<p>In this thoughtless manner he spent his time and fortune;
never applying to any profession, though formed to shine in any
one he should have chosen.&nbsp; His friends were offended, and
at last allowed him to languish in a gaol; and as there appeared
no probability of reforming or fixing him, they left him to
struggle with adversity.</p>
<p>Severely did he reproach himself&mdash;He was almost lost in
despair, when a friend visited him.&nbsp; This friend loved the
latent sparks of virtue which he imagined would some time or
other light up, and animate his conduct.&nbsp; He paid his debts,
and gave him a sum of money sufficient to enable him to prepare
for a voyage to the East Indies, where Charles wished to go, to
try to regain his lost fortune.&nbsp; Through the intercession of
this kind, considerate friend, his relations were reconciled to
him, and his spirits raised.</p>
<p>He sailed with a fair wind, and fortune favouring his most
romantic wishes, in the space of fifteen years, he acquired a
much larger fortune than he had even hoped for, and thought of
visiting, nay, settling in his native country for the remainder
of his life.</p>
<p>Though impressed by the most lively sense of gratitude, he had
dropped his friend&rsquo;s correspondence; yet, as he knew that
he had a daughter, his first determination was to reserve for her
the greater part of his property, as the most substantial proof
which he could give of his gratitude.&mdash;The thought pleased
him, and that was sufficient to divert him for some months; but
accidentally hearing that his friend had been very unsuccessful
in trade, this <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>information made him wish to hasten his return to his
native country.&nbsp; Still a procrastinating spirit possessed
him, and he delayed from time to time the arduous task of
settling his affairs, previous to his departure: he wrote,
however, to England, and transmitted a considerable sum to a
correspondent, desiring that this house might be prepared for
him, and the mortgage cleared.</p>
<p>I can scarcely enumerate the various delays that prevented his
embarking; and when he arrived in England, he came here, and was
so childishly eager to have his house fitted up with taste, that
he actually trifled away a month, before he went to seek for his
friend.</p>
<p>But his negligence was now severely punished.&nbsp; He learned
that he had been reduced to great distress, and thrown into the
very gaol, out of which he took Townley, who, hastening to it,
only found his dead body there; for he died the day before.&nbsp;
On the table was lying, amidst some other scraps of paper, a
letter, directed in an unsteady hand to Charles Townley.&nbsp; He
tore it open.&nbsp; Few were the scarcely legible lines; but they
smote his heart.&nbsp; He read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been reduced by unforeseen misfortunes; yet when
I heard of your arrival, a gleam of joy cheered my
heart&mdash;<i>I thought I knew your&rsquo;s</i>, and that my
latter days might still have been made comfortable in your
society, for I loved you; I even expected pleasure; but I was
mistaken; death is my only friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He read it over and over again; and cried out, Gracious God,
had I arrived but one day sooner I should have seen him, and he
would not have died thinking me the most ungrateful wretch that
ever burdened the earth!&nbsp; He then knocked his clinched <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>fist against
his forehead, looked wildly round the dreary apartment, and
exclaimed in a choked, though impatient tone, You sat here
yesterday, thinking of my ingratitude&mdash;Where are you
now!&nbsp; Oh! that I had seen you!&nbsp; Oh! that my repenting
sighs could reach you!&mdash;</p>
<p>He ordered the body to be interred, and returned home a prey
to grief and despondency.&nbsp; Indulging it to excess, he
neglected to enquire after his friend&rsquo;s daughter; he
intended to provide amply for her, but now he could only
grieve.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed, then he sent, and the intelligence which he
procured aggravated his distress, and gave it a severe additional
sting.</p>
<p>The poor gentle girl had, during her father&rsquo;s life, been
engaged to a worthy young man; but, some time after his death,
the relations of her lover had sent him to sea to prevent the
match taking place.&nbsp; She was helpless, and had not
sufficient courage to combat with poverty; to escape from it, she
married an old rake whom she detested.&nbsp; He was ill-humoured,
and his vicious habits rendered him a most dreadful
companion.&nbsp; She tried in vain to please him, and banish the
sorrow that bent her down, and made wealth and all the pleasures
it could procure tasteless.&nbsp; Her tender father was
dead&mdash;she had lost her lover&mdash;without a friend or
confident, silent grief consumed her.&nbsp; I have told you
friendship is only to be found amongst the virtuous; her husband
was vicious.</p>
<p>Ah! why did she marry, said Mary?</p>
<p>Because she was timid; but I have not told you all; the grief
that did not break her heart, disturbed her reason; and her
husband confined her in a madhouse.</p>
<p>Charles heard of this last circumstance; he visited her.&nbsp;
Fanny, said he, do you recollect your old friend?&nbsp; <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Fanny looked
at him, and reason for a moment resumed her seat, and informed
her countenance to trace anguish on it&mdash;the trembling light
soon disappeared&mdash;wild fancy flushed in her eyes, and
animated her incessant rant.&nbsp; She sung several verses of
different songs, talked of her husband&rsquo;s
ill-usage&mdash;enquired if he had lately been to sea?&nbsp; And
frequently addressed her father as if he were behind her chair,
or sitting by her.</p>
<p>Charles could not bear this scene&mdash;If I could lose like
her a sense of woe, he cried, this intolerable anguish would not
tear my heart!&nbsp; The fortune which he had intended for her
could not restore her reason; but, had he sent for her soon after
her father&rsquo;s death, he might have saved her and comforted
himself.</p>
<p>The last stroke was worse than the first; he retired to this
abode; melancholy creeping on him, he let his beard grow, and the
garden run wild.&nbsp; One room in the house the poor lunatic
inhabited; and he had a proper person to attend her, and guard
her from the dangers she wished to encounter.&nbsp; Every day he
visited her, the sight of her would almost have unhinged a sound
mind&mdash;How could he bear it, when his conscience reproached
him, and whispered that he had neglected to do good, to live to
any rational purpose&mdash;The sweets of friendship were denied,
and he every day contemplated the saddest of all sights&mdash;the
wreck of a human understanding.</p>
<p>He died without a will.&nbsp; The estate was litigated, and as
the title to this part could not be proved, the house was let
fall into its present state.</p>

<p>But the night will overtake us, we must make haste
home&mdash;Give me your hand, Mary, you tremble; surely I need
not desire you to remember this story&mdash;Be calm, my child,
and remember that you must attend to trifles; do all the good you
can the present <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>day, nay hour, if you would keep your conscience
clear.&nbsp; This circumspection may not produce dazzling
actions, nor will your silent virtue be supported by human
applause; but your Father, who seeth in secret, will reward
you.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Dress.&mdash;A Character.&mdash;Remarks on
Mrs. Trueman&rsquo;s Manner of dressing.&mdash;Trifling Omissions
undermine Affection.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s procrastinating temper produced many other ill
consequences; she would lie in bed till the last moment, and then
appear without washing her face or cleaning her teeth.&nbsp; Mrs.
Mason had often observed it, and hinted her dislike; but,
unwilling to burden her with precepts, she waited for a glaring
example.&nbsp; One was soon accidentally thrown in her way, and
she determined that it should not pass unobserved.</p>
<p>A lady, who was remarkable for her negligence in this respect,
spent a week with them; and, during that time, very frequently
disconcerted the economy of the family.&nbsp; She was seldom fit
to be seen, and if any company came by chance to dinner, she
would make them wait till it was quite cold, whilst she huddled
on some ill-chosen finery.&nbsp; In the same style, if a little
party of pleasure was proposed, she had to dress herself, and the
hurry discomposed her, and tired those, who did not like to lose
time in anticipating a trifling amusement.</p>
<p>A few hours after she had left them, Mrs. Mason enquired of
Mary, what effect this week&rsquo;s experience had had on her
mind?&nbsp; You are fond of ridicule, child, but seldom in the
right place; real cause for it <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>you let slip, and heed not the silent
reproof that points at your own faults: do not mistake me, I
would not have you laugh at&mdash;yet I wish you to feel, what is
ridiculous, and learn to distinguish folly.&nbsp; Mrs.
Dowdy&rsquo;s negligence arises from indolence; her mind is not
employed about matters of importance; and, if it were, it would
not be a sufficient excuse for her habitually neglecting an
essential part of a man&rsquo;s as well as a woman&rsquo;s
duty.&nbsp; I said habitually; grief will often make those
careless, who, at other times, pay a proper attention to their
person; and this neglect is a sure indication that the
canker-worm is at work; and we ought to pity, rather than blame
the unfortunate.&nbsp; Indeed when painful activity of mind
occasions this inattention, it will not last long; the soul
struggles to free itself, and return to its usual tone and old
habits.&nbsp; The lady we have been speaking of, ever appears a
sloven, though she is sometimes a disgusting figure, and, at
others, a very taudry flirt.</p>
<p>I continually caution Caroline not to spend much time in
adorning her person; but I never desired you to neglect
yours.&nbsp; Wisdom consists in avoiding
extremes&mdash;immoderate fondness for dress, I term vanity; but
a proper attention to avoid singularity does not deserve that
name.&nbsp; Never waste much time about trifles; but the time
that is necessary, employ properly.&nbsp; Exercise your
understanding, taste flows from it, and will in a moment direct
you, if you are not too solicitous to conform to the changing
fashions; and loiter away in laborious idleness the precious
moments when the imagination is most lively, and should be
allowed to fix virtuous affections in the tender youthful
heart.</p>
<p>Of all the women whom I have ever met with, Mrs. Trueman seems
the freest from vanity, and those frivolous views which degrade
the female character.&nbsp; <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Her virtues claim respect, and the
practice of them engrosses her thoughts; yet her clothes are
apparently well chosen, and you always see her in the same
attire.&nbsp; Not like many women who are eager to set off their
persons to the best advantage, when they are only going to take a
walk, and are careless, nay slovenly, when forced to stay at
home.&nbsp; Mrs. Trueman&rsquo;s conduct is just the reverse, she
tries to avoid singularity, for she does not wish to disgust the
generality; but it is her family, her friends, whom she studies
to please.</p>
<p>In dress it is not little minute things, but the whole that
should be attended to, and that every day; and this attention
gives an ease to the person because the clothes appear unstudily
graceful.&nbsp; Never, continued Mrs. Mason, desire to excel in
trifles, if you do&mdash;there is an end to virtuous emulation,
the mind cannot attend to both; for when the main pursuit is
trivial, the character will of course become insignificant.&nbsp;
Habitual neatness is laudable; but, if you wish to be reckoned a
well, an elegantly dressed girl; and feel that praise on account
of it gives you pleasure, you are vain; and a laudable ambition
cannot dwell with vanity.</p>
<p>Servants, and those women whose minds have had a very limited
range, place all their happiness in ornaments, and frequently
neglect the only essential part in dress,&mdash;neatness.</p>
<p>I have not the least objection to your dressing according to
your age; I rather encourage it, by allowing you to wear the
gayest colours; yet I insist on some degree of uniformity: and
think you treat me disrespectfully when you appear before me, and
have forgotten to do, what should never be neglected, and what
you could have done in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>I
always dress myself before breakfast, and expect you to follow my
example, if there is not a sufficient, and obvious excuse.&nbsp;
You, Mary, missed a pleasant airing yesterday; for if you had not
forgotten the respect which is due to me, and hurried down to
breakfast in a slovenly manner, I should have taken you out with
me; but I did not choose to wait till you were ready, as your not
being so was entirely your own fault.</p>
<p>Fathers, and men in general, complain of this inattention;
they have always to wait for females.&nbsp; Learn to avoid this
fault, however insignificant it may appear in your eyes, for that
habit cannot be of little consequence that sometimes weakens
esteem.&nbsp; When we frequently make allowance for another in
trifling matters, notions of inferiority take root in the mind,
and too often produce contempt.&nbsp; Respect for the
understanding must be the basis of constancy; the tenderness
which flows from pity is liable to perish insensibly, to consume
itself&mdash;even the virtues of the heart, when they degenerate
into weakness, sink a character in our estimation.&nbsp; Besides,
a kind of gross familiarity, takes place of decent affection; and
the respect which alone can render domestic intimacy a lasting
comfort is lost before we are aware of it.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Behaviour to Servants.&mdash;True Dignity of
Character.</p>
<p>The children not coming down to breakfast one morning at the
usual time, Mrs. Mason went herself to enquire the reason; and as
she entered the apartment, heard Mary say to the maid who
assisted her, I wonder at your impertinence, to talk thus to
me&mdash;do you know who you are speaking to?&mdash;she was going
on; but Mrs. Mason interrupted her, and <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>answered the
question&mdash;to a little girl, who is only assisted because she
is weak.&nbsp; Mary shrunk back abashed, and Mrs. Mason
continued, as you have treated Betty, who is ten years older than
yourself, improperly, you must now do every thing for yourself;
and, as you will be some time about it, Caroline and I will eat
our breakfast, and visit Mrs. Trueman.&nbsp; By the time we
return, you may perhaps have recollected that children are
inferior to servants&mdash;who act from the dictates of reason,
and whose understandings are arrived at some degree of maturity,
while children must be governed and directed till
<i>their&rsquo;s</i> gains strength to work by itself: for it is
the proper exercise of our reason that makes us in any degree
independent.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Mason returned, she mildly addressed Mary.&nbsp; I
have often told you that every dispensation of Providence tended
to our improvement, if we do not perversely act contrary to our
interest.&nbsp; One being is made dependent on another, that love
and forbearance may soften the human heart, and that linked
together by necessity, and the exercise of the social affections,
the whole family on earth might have a fellow feeling for each
other.&nbsp; By these means we improve one another; but there is
no real inferiority.</p>
<p>You have read the fable of the head supposing itself superior
to the rest of the members, though all are equally necessary to
the support of life.&nbsp; If I behave improperly to servants, I
am really their inferior, as I abuse a trust, and imitate not the
Being, whose servant I am, without a shadow of equality.&nbsp;
Children are helpless.&nbsp; I order my servants to wait on you,
because you are so; but I have not as much respect for you as for
them; you may possibly become a virtuous character.&mdash;Many of
my <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>servants are really so already; they have done their
duty, filled an humble station, as they ought to fill it,
conscientiously.&nbsp; And do you dare to despise those whom your
Creator approves?</p>
<p>Before the greatest earthly beings I should not be awed, they
are my fellow servants; and, though superior in rank, which, like
personal beauty, only dazzles the vulgar; yet I may possess more
knowledge and virtue.&nbsp; The same feeling actuates me when I
am in company with the poor; we are creatures of the same nature,
and I may be their inferiour in those graces which should adorn
my soul, and render me truly great.</p>
<p>How often must I repeat to you, that a child is inferiour to a
man; because reason is in its infancy, and it is reason which
exalts a man above a brute; and the cultivation of it raises the
wise man above the ignorant; for wisdom is only another name for
virtue.</p>
<p>This morning, when I entered your apartment, I heard you
insult a worthy servant.&nbsp; You had just said your prayers;
but they must have been only the gabble of the tongue; your heart
was not engaged in the sacred employment, or you could not so
soon have forgotten that you were a weak, dependent being, and
that you were to receive mercy and kindness only on the condition
of your practising the same.</p>
<p>I advise you to ask Betty to pardon your impertinence; till
you do so, she shall not assist you; you would find yourself very
helpless without the assistance of men and women&mdash;unable to
cook your meat, bake your bread, wash your clothes, or even put
them on&mdash;such a helpless creature is a child&mdash;I know
what you are, you perceive.</p>
<p>Mary submitted&mdash;and in future after she said her prayers,
remembered that she was to endeavour to curb her temper.</p>
<h3><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Employment.&mdash;Idleness produces
Misery.&mdash;The Cultivation of the Fancy raises us above the
Vulgar, extends our Happiness, and leads to Virtue.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Mrs. Mason gave the children leave to amuse
themselves; but a kind of listlessness hung over them, and at a
loss what to do, they seemed fatigued with doing nothing.&nbsp;
They eat cakes though they had just dined, and did many foolish
things merely because they were idle.&nbsp; Their friend seeing
that they were irresolute, and could not fix on any employment,
requested Caroline to assist her to make some clothes, that a
poor woman was in want of, and while we are at work, she added,
Mary will read us an entertaining tale, which I will point
out.</p>
<p>The tale interested the children, who chearfully attended, and
after it was finished, Mrs. Mason told them, that as she had some
letters to write, she could not take her accustomed walk; but
that she would allow them to represent her, and act for once like
women.&nbsp; They received their commission, it was to take the
clothes to the poor woman, whom they were intended for; learn her
present wants; exercise their own judgment with respect to the
immediate relief she stood in need of, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>They returned home delighted, eager to tell what they had
done, and how thankful, and happy they had left the poor
woman.</p>
<p>Observe now, said Mrs. Mason, the advantages arising from
employment; three hours ago, you were uncomfortable, without
being sensible of the cause, and knew not what to do with
yourselves.&nbsp; Nay, you actually committed a sin; for you
devoured cakes without feeling hunger, merely to kill time,
whilst <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>many poor people have not the means of satisfying their
natural wants.&nbsp; When I desired you to read to me you were
amused; and now you have been useful you are delighted.&nbsp;
Recollect this in future when you are at a loss what to do with
yourselves&mdash;and remember that idleness must always be
intolerable, because it is only an irksome consciousness of
existence.</p>
<p>Every gift of Heaven is lent to us for our improvement; fancy
is one of the first of the inferiour ones; in cultivating it, we
acquire what is called taste, or a relish for particular
employments, which occupy our leisure hours, and raise us above
the vulgar in our conversation.&nbsp; Those who have not any
taste talk always of their own affairs or of their neighbours;
every trivial matter that occurs within their knowledge they
convass and conjecture about&mdash;not so much out of ill-nature
as idleness: just as you eat the cakes without the impulse of
hunger.&nbsp; In the same style people talk of eating and dress,
and long for their meals merely to divide the day, because the
intermediate time is not employed in a more interesting
manner.&nbsp; Every new branch of taste that we cultivate,
affords us a refuge from idleness, a fortress in which we may
resist the assaults of vice; and the more noble our employments,
the more exalted will our minds become.</p>
<p>Music, drawing, works of usefulness and fancy, all amuse and
refine the mind, sharpen the ingenuity; and form, insensibly, the
dawning judgment.&mdash;As the judgment gains strength, so do the
passions also; we have actions to weigh, and need that taste in
conduct, that delicate sense of propriety, which gives grace to
virtue.&nbsp; The highest branch of solitary amusement is
reading; but even in the choice of books the fancy is first
employed; for in reading, the heart is touched, till its feelings
are examined by the understanding, <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and the ripenings of reason regulate
the imagination.&nbsp; This is the work of years, and the most
important of all employments.&nbsp; When life advances, if the
heart has been capable of receiving early impressions, and the
head of reasoning and retaining the conclusions which were drawn
from them; we have acquired a stock of knowledge, a gold mine
which we can occasionally recur to, independent of outward
circumstances.</p>
<p>The supreme Being has every thing in Himself; we proceed from
Him, and our knowledge and affections must return to Him for
employment suited to them.&nbsp; And those who most resemble Him
ought, next to Him, to be the objects of our love; and the beings
whom we should try to associate with, that we may receive an
inferiour degree of satisfaction from their society.&mdash;But be
assured our chief comfort must ever arise from the mind&rsquo;s
reviewing its own operations&mdash;and the whispers of an
approving conscience, to convince us that life has not slipped
away unemployed.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Innocent Amusements.&mdash;Description of a
Welsh Castle.&mdash;History of a Welsh Harper.&mdash;A tyrannical
Landlord.&mdash;Family Pride.</p>
<p>As it was now harvest time, the new scene, and the fine
weather delighted the children, who ran continually out to view
the reapers.&nbsp; Indeed every thing seemed to wear a face of
festivity, and the ripe corn bent under its own weight, or, more
erect, shewed the laughing appearance of plenty.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason always allowing the gleaners to have a sufficient
quantity, a great number of poor came to <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>gather a
little harvest; and she was pleased to see the feeble hands of
childhood and age, collecting the scattered ears.</p>
<p>Honest Jack came with his family; and when the labours of the
day were over, would play on a fiddle, that frequently had but
three strings.&nbsp; But it served to set the feet in motion, and
the lads and lasses dancing on the green sod, suffered every care
to sleep.</p>
<p>An old Welsh harper generally came to the house about this
time of the year, and staid a month or more; for Mrs. Mason was
particularly fond of this instrument, and interested in the fate
of the player; as is almost always the case, when we have rescued
a person out of any distress.</p>
<p>She informed the children, that once travelling through Wales,
her carriage was overturned near the ruins of an old
castle.&nbsp; And as she had escaped unhurt, she determined to
wander amongst them, whilst the driver took care of his horses,
and her servant hastened to the neighbouring village for
assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p56.jpg">
<img alt=
"Trying to trace the sound"
title=
"Trying to trace the sound"
src="images/p56.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It was almost dark, and the lights began to twinkle in the
scattered cottages.&nbsp; The scene pleased me, continued Mrs.
Mason, I thought of the various customs which the lapse of time
unfolds; and dwelt on the state of the Welsh, when this castle,
now so desolate, was the hospitable abode of the chief of a noble
family.&nbsp; These reflections entirely engrossed my mind, when
the sound of a harp reached my ears.&nbsp; Never was any thing
more opportune, the national music seemed to give reality to the
pictures which my imagination had been drawing.&nbsp; I listened
awhile, and then trying to trace the pleasing sound, discovered,
after a short search, a little hut, rudely built.&nbsp; The walls
of an old tower supported part of the thatch, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>which
scarcely kept out the rain, and the two other sides were stones
cemented, or rather plaistered together, by mud and clay.</p>
<p>I entered, and beheld an old man, sitting by a few loose
sticks, which blazed on the hearth; and a young woman, with one
child at her breast, sucking, and another on her knee: near them
stood a cow and her calf.&nbsp; The man had been playing on the
harp, he rose when he saw me, and offered his chair, the only one
in the room, and sat down on a large chest in the
chimney-corner.&nbsp; When the door was shut, all the light that
was admitted came through the hole, called a chimney, and did not
much enliven the dwelling.&nbsp; I mentioned my accident to
account for my intrusion, and requested the harper again to touch
the instrument that had attracted me.&nbsp; A partition of twigs
and dried leaves divided this apartment from another, in which I
perceived a light; I enquired about it, and the woman, in an
artless manner, informed me, that she had let it to a young
gentlewoman lately married, who was related to a very good
family, and would not lodge any where, or with any body.&nbsp;
This intelligence made me smile, to think that family pride
should be a solace in such extreme poverty.</p>
<p>I sat there some time, and then the harper accompanied me to
see whether the carriage was repaired; I found it waiting for me;
and as the inn I was to sleep at was only about two miles
further, the harper offered to come and play to me whilst I was
eating my supper.&nbsp; This was just what I wished for, his
appearance had roused my compassion as well as my curiosity, and
I took him and his harp in the chaise.&nbsp; After supper he
informed me, that he had once a very good farm; but he had been
so unfortunate as to displease the justice, who never forgave
him, nor rested till he had ruined him.&nbsp; This tyrant always
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>expected
his tenants to assist him to bring in his harvest before they had
got in their own.&nbsp; The poor harper was once in the midst of
his, when an order was sent to him to bring his carts and
servants, the next day, to the fields of this petty king.&nbsp;
He foolishly refused; and this refusal was the foundation of that
settled hatred which produced such fatal consequences.&nbsp; Ah,
Madam, said the sufferer, your heart would ache, if you heard of
all his cruelties to me, and the rest of his poor tenants.&nbsp;
He employs many labourers, and will not give them as much wages
as they could get from the common farmers, yet they dare not go
any-where else to work when he sends for them.&nbsp; The fish
that they catch they must bring first to him, or they would not
be allowed to walk over his grounds to catch them; and he will
give just what he pleases for the most valuable part of their
pannier.</p>
<p>But there would be no end to my story were I to tell you of
all his oppressions.&nbsp; I was obliged to leave my farm; and my
daughter, whom you saw this evening, having married an
industrious young man, I came to live with them.&nbsp;
When,&mdash;would you believe it? this same man threw my son into
jail, on account of his killing a hare, which all the country
folks do when they can catch them in their grounds.&nbsp; We were
again in great distress, and my daughter and I built the hut you
saw in the waste, that the poor babes might have a shelter.&nbsp;
I maintain them by playing on the harp,&mdash;the master of this
inn allows me to play to the gentry who travel this way; so that
I pick up a few pence, just enough to keep life and soul
together, and to enable me to send a little bread to my poor son
John Thomas.</p>
<p>He then began one of the most dismal of his Welsh ditties,
and, in the midst of it cried out, he is an <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>upstart, a
mere mushroom!&mdash;His grandfather was cow-boy to
mine!&mdash;So I told him once, and he never forgot
it.&mdash;</p>
<p>The old man then informed me that the castle in which he now
was sheltered formerly belonged to his family&mdash;such are the
changes and chances of this mortal life&mdash;said he, and
hastily struck up a lively tune.&mdash;</p>
<p>While he was striking the strings, I thought too of the
changes in life which an age had produced.&nbsp; The descendant
of those who had made the hall ring with social mirth now mourned
in its ruins, and hung his harp on the mouldering
battlements.&nbsp; Such is the fate of buildings and of
families!</p>
<p>After I had dismissed my guest, I sent for the landlord, to
make some further enquiries; and found that I had not been
deceived; I then determined to assist him, and thought my
accident providential.&nbsp; I knew a man of consequence in the
neighbourhood, I visited him, and exerted myself to procure the
enlargement of the young man.&nbsp; I succeeded; and not only
restored him to his family; but prevailed on my friend to let him
rent a small farm on his estate, and I gave him money to buy
stock for it, and the implements of husbandry.</p>
<p>The old harper&rsquo;s gratitude was unbounded; the summer
after he walked to visit me; and ever since he has contrived to
come every year to enliven our harvest-home.&mdash;This evening
it is to be celebrated.</p>
<p>The evening came; the joyous party footed it away merrily, and
the sound of their shoes was heard on the barn-floor.&nbsp; It
was not the light fantastic toe, that fashion taught to move, but
honest heart-felt mirth, and the loud laugh, if it spoke the
vacant head, said audibly that the heart was guileless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason always gave them some trifling presents <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>at this time,
to render the approach of winter more comfortable.&nbsp; To the
men, she generally presented warm clothing, and to the women flax
and worsted for knitting and spinning; and those who were the
most industrious received a reward when the new year
commenced.&nbsp; The children had books given to them, and little
ornaments.&mdash;All were anxious for the day; and received their
old acquaintance, the harper, with the most cordial smiles.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Prayer.&mdash;A Moon-light
Scene.&mdash;Resignation.</p>
<p>The harper would frequently sit under a large elm, a few paces
from the house, and play some of the most plaintive Welsh
tunes.&nbsp; While the people were eating their supper, Mrs.
Mason desired him to play her some favourite airs; and she and
the children walked round the tree under which he sat, on the
stump of another.</p>
<p>The moon rose in cloudless majesty, and a number of stars
twinkled near her.&nbsp; The softened landscape inspired
tranquillity, while the strain of rustic melody gave a pleasing
melancholy to the whole&mdash;and made the tear start, whose
source could scarcely be traced.&nbsp; The pleasure the sight of
harmless mirth gave rise to in Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s bosom, roused
every tender feeling&mdash;set in motion her spirits.&mdash;She
laughed with the poor whom she had made happy, and wept when she
recollected her own sorrows; the illusions of youth&mdash;the gay
expectations that had formerly clipped the wings of
time.&mdash;She turned to the girls&mdash;I have been very
unfortunate, my young friends; but my griefs are now of a placid
kind.&nbsp; Heavy misfortunes have <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>obscured the sun I gazed at when
first I entered life&mdash;early attachments have been
broken&mdash;the death of friends I loved has so clouded my days;
that neither the beams of prosperity, nor even those of
benevolence, can dissipate the gloom; but I am not lost in a
thick fog.&mdash;My state of mind rather resembles the scene
before you, it is quiet&mdash;I am weaned from the world, but not
disgusted&mdash;for I can still do good&mdash;and in futurity a
sun will rise to cheer my heart.&mdash;Beyond the night of death,
I hail the dawn of an eternal day!&nbsp; I mention my state of
mind to you, that I may tell you what supports me.</p>
<p>The festivity within, and the placidity without, led my
thoughts naturally to the source from whence my comfort
springs&mdash;to the Great Bestower of every blessing.&nbsp;
Prayer, my children, is the dearest privilege of man, and the
support of a feeling heart.&nbsp; Mine has too often been wounded
by ingratitude; my fellow-creatures, whom I have fondly loved,
have neglected me&mdash;I have heard their last sigh, and thrown
my eyes round an empty world; but then more particularly feeling
the presence of my Creator, I poured out my soul before
Him&mdash;and was no longer alone!&mdash;I now daily contemplate
His wonderful goodness; and, though at an awful distance, try to
imitate Him.&nbsp; This view of things is a spur to activity, and
a consolation in disappointment.</p>
<p>There is in fact a constant intercourse kept up with the
Creator, when we learn to consider Him, as the fountain of truth,
which our understanding naturally thirsts after.&nbsp; But His
goodness brings Him still more on a level with our bounded
capacities&mdash;for we trace it in every work of mercy, and
feel, in sorrow particularly, His fatherly care.&nbsp; Every
blessing is doubled when we suppose it comes from Him, and
afflictions almost lose their name when we <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>believe they
are sent to correct, not crush us.&mdash;Whilst we are alive to
gratitude and admiration, we must adore God.</p>
<p>The human soul is so framed, that goodness and truth must fill
it with ineffable pleasure, and the nearer it approaches to
perfection, the more earnestly will it pursue those virtues,
discerning more clearly their beauty.</p>
<p>The Supreme Being dwells in the universe.&nbsp; He is as
essentially present to the wicked as to the good; but the latter
delight in His presence, and try to please Him, whilst the former
shrink from a Judge, who is of too pure a nature to behold
iniquity.&mdash;The wicked wish for the rocks to cover them,
mountains, or the angry sea, which we the other day surveyed, to
hide them from the presence of that Being&mdash;in whose presence
only they could find joy.&nbsp; You feel emotions that incite you
to do good; and painful ones disturb you, when you have resisted
the faithful internal monitor.&nbsp; The wiser, and the better
you grow, the more visible, if I may use the expression, will God
become&mdash;For wisdom consists in searching Him out&mdash;and
goodness in endeavouring to copy His attributes.</p>
<p>To attain any thing great, a model must be held up to exercise
our understanding, and engage our affections.&nbsp; A view of the
disinterested goodness of God is therefore calculated to touch us
more than can be conceived by a depraved mind.&nbsp; When the
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts; true courage will
animate our conduct, for nothing can hurt those who trust in
Him.&nbsp; If the desire of acting right is ever present with us,
if admiration of goodness fills our souls; we may be said to pray
constantly.&nbsp; And if we try to do justice to all our
fellow-creatures, and even to the brute creation; and assist them
as far as <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>we can, we prove whose servants we are, and whose laws
we transcribe in our lives.</p>
<p>Never be very anxious, when you pray, what <i>words</i> to
use; regulate your <i>thoughts</i>; and recollect that virtue
calms the passions, gives clearness to the understanding, and
opens it to pleasures that the thoughtless and vicious have not a
glimpse of.&nbsp; You must, believe me, be acquainted with God to
find peace, to rise superior to worldly temptations.&nbsp;
Habitual devotion is of the utmost consequence to our happiness,
as what oftenest occupies the thoughts will influence our
actions.&nbsp; But, observe what I say,&mdash;<i>that</i>
devotion is mockery and selfishness, which does not improve our
moral character.</p>
<p>Men, of old, prayed to the devil, sacrificed their children to
him; and committed every kind of barbarity and impurity.&nbsp;
But we who serve a long-suffering God should pity the weakness of
our fellow-creatures; we must not beg for mercy and not shew
it;&mdash;we must not acknowledge that we have offended, without
trying to avoid doing so in future.&nbsp; We are to deal with our
fellow-creatures as we expect to be dealt with.&nbsp; This is
practical prayer!&mdash;Those who practise it feel frequently
sublime pleasures, and lively hopes animate them in this vale of
tears; that seem a foretaste of the felicity they will enjoy,
when the understanding is more enlightened, and the affections
properly regulated.</p>
<p>To-morrow I will take you to visit the school-mistress of the
village, and relate her story, to enforce what I have been
saying.</p>
<p>Now you may go and dance one or two dances; and I will join
you after I have taken a walk, which I wish to enjoy alone.</p>

64</span>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The Benefits arising from Devotion.&mdash;The
History of the Village School-mistress.&mdash;Fatal Effects of
Inattention to Expences, in the History of Mr. Lofty.</p>
<p>The next morning Mrs. Mason desired the children to get their
work, and draw near the table whilst she related the promised
history; and in the afternoon, if the weather be fine, they were
to visit the village school-mistress.</p>
<p>Her father, the honourable Mr. Lofty, was the youngest son of
a noble family; his education had been liberal, though his
fortune was small.&nbsp; His relations, however, seemed
determined to push him forward in life, before he disobliged them
by marrying the daughter of a country clergyman, an accomplished,
sensible woman.</p>
<p>Some time after the birth of his daughter Anna, his elder
brother, the Earl of Caermarthen, was reconciled to him; but this
reconciliation only led him into expences, which his limited
fortune could not bear.&nbsp; Mr. Lofty had a high sense of
honour, and rather a profuse turn; he was, beside, a very humane
man, and gave away much more than he could afford to give, when
his compassion was excited.&nbsp; He never did a mean action; but
sometimes an ostentatious pride tarnished the lustre of very
splendid ones, made them appear to judicious eyes, more like
tinsel, than gold.&nbsp; I will account for it.&nbsp; His first
impulse arose from sensibility, and the second from an immoderate
desire of human applause: for he seemed not to be alive to
devotional feelings, or to have that rock to rest on, which will
support a frail being, and give true dignity to a character,
though all nature combined to crush it.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Mrs.
Lofty was not a shining character&mdash;but I will read you a
part of a letter, which her daughter, the lady we are to visit,
wrote to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This being the anniversary of the day on which an ever
loved, and much revered parent was released from the bondage of
mortality, I observe it with particular seriousness, and with
gratitude; for her sorrows were great, her trials
severe&mdash;but her conduct was blameless: yet the world admired
her not; her silent, modest virtues, were not formed to attract
the notice of the injudicious crowd, and her understanding was
not brilliant enough to excite admiration.&nbsp; But she was
regardless of the opinion of the world; she sought her reward in
the source from whence her virtue was derived&mdash;and she found
it.&mdash;He, who, for wise and merciful purposes, suffered her
to be afflicted, supported her under her trials; thereby calling
forth the exercise of those virtues with which He had adorned her
gentle soul; and imparting to her a degree of heart-felt comfort,
which no earthly blessing could afford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This amiable parent died when Anna was near eighteen, and left
her to the care of her father, whose high spirit she had
imbibed.&nbsp; However, the religious principles which her mother
had instilled regulated her notions of honour, and so elevated
her character, that her heart was regulated by her
understanding.</p>
<p>Her father who had insensibly involved himself in debt, after
her mother&rsquo;s death, tried many different schemes of life,
all of which, at first wore a promising aspect; but wanting that
suppleness of temper, that enables people to rise in the world,
his struggles, instead of extricating, sunk him still
deeper.&nbsp; Wanting also the support of religion, he became
sour, easily irritated, and almost hated a world whose applause
he had once eagerly courted.&nbsp; His affairs were at last <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>in such a
desperate state, that he was obliged, reluctantly, to accept of
an invitation from his brother, who with his wife, a weak fine
lady, intended to spend some time on the continent; his daughter
was, of course, to be of the party.</p>
<p>The restraint of obligations did not suit his temper, and
feeling himself dependent, he imagined every one meant to insult
him.</p>
<p>Some sarcasms were thrown out one day by a gentleman, in a
large company; they were not personal, yet he took fire.&nbsp;
His sore mind was easily hurt, he resented them; and heated by
wine, they both said more than their cool reason would have
suggested.&nbsp; Mr. Lofty imagined his honour was wounded, and
the next morning sent him a challenge&mdash;They met&mdash;and he
killed his antagonist, who, dying, pardoned him, and declared
that the sentiments which had given him so much offence, fell
from him by accident, and were not levelled at any person.</p>
<p>The dying man lamented, that the thread of a thoughtless life
had been so suddenly snapped&mdash;the name of his wife and
children he could not articulate, when something like a prayer
for them escaped his livid lips, and shook his exhausted
frame&mdash;The blood flowed in a copious stream&mdash;vainly did
Mr. Lofty endeavour to staunch it&mdash;the heart lost its vital
nourishment&mdash;and the soul escaped as he pressed the hand of
his destroyer.&mdash;Who, when he found him breathless, ran home,
and rushed in a hurry into his own chamber.&nbsp; The dead
man&rsquo;s image haunted his imagination&mdash;he
started&mdash;imagined that he was at his elbow&mdash;and shook
the hand that had received the dying grasp&mdash;yet still it was
pressed, and the pressure entered into his very soul&mdash;On the
table lay two pistols, he caught up one,&mdash;and shot
himself.&mdash;The report alarmed the family&mdash;the servants
and his <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>daughter, for his brother was not at home, broke open
the door,&mdash;and she saw the dreadful sight!&nbsp; As there
was still some appearance of life, a trembling ray&mdash;she
supported the body, and sent for assistance.&nbsp; But he soon
died in her arms without speaking, before the servant returned
with a surgeon.</p>
<p>Horror seized her, another pistol lay charged on the table,
she caught it up, but religion held her hand&mdash;she knelt down
by a dead father, and prayed to a superior one.&nbsp; Her mind
grew calmer&mdash;yet still she passionately wished she had but
heard him speak, or that she had conveyed comfort to his
departing spirit&mdash;where, where would it find comfort? again
she was obliged to have recourse to prayer.</p>
<p>After the death of her father, her aunt treated her as if she
were a mere dependent on her bounty; and expected her to be an
humble companion in every sense of the word.&nbsp; The visitors
took the tone from her ladyship, and numberless were the
mortifications she had to bear.</p>
<p>The entrance of a person about business interrupted the
narration; but Mrs. Mason promised to resume it after dinner.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The Benefits arising from Devotion.&mdash;The
History of the Village School-mistress concluded.</p>
<p>As soon as the cloth was removed, Mrs. Mason concluded the
narration; and the girls forgot their fruit whilst they were
listening to the sequel.</p>
<p>Anna endured this treatment some years, and had an opportunity
of acquiring a knowledge of the world and her own heart.&nbsp;
She visited her mother&rsquo;s father, and would have remained
with him; but she <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>determined not to lessen the small pittance which he had
anxiously saved out of a scanty income for two other
grand-children.&nbsp; She thought continually of her situation,
and found, on examining her understanding, that the fashionable
circle in which she moved, could not at any rate have afforded
her much satisfaction, or even amusement; though the neglect and
contempt that she met with rendered her very uncomfortable.&nbsp;
She had her father&rsquo;s spirit of independence, and determined
to shake off the galling yoke which she had long struggled with,
and try to earn her own subsistence.&nbsp; Her acquaintance
expostulated with her, and represented the miseries of poverty,
and the mortifications and difficulties that she would have to
encounter.&nbsp; Let it be so, she replied, it is much preferable
to swelling the train of the proud or vicious great, and
despising myself for bearing their impertinence, for eating their
bitter bread;&mdash;better, indeed, is a dinner of herbs with
contentment.&nbsp; My wants are few.&nbsp; When I am my own
mistress, the crust I earn will be sweet, and the water that
moistens it will not be mingled with tears of sorrow or
indignation.</p>
<p>To shorten my story; she came to me, after she had attempted
several plans, and requested my advice.&nbsp; She would not
accept of any considerable favour, and declared that the greatest
would be, to put her in a way of supporting herself, without
forfeiting her highly valued independence.&nbsp; I knew not what
to advise; but whilst I was debating the matter with myself, I
happened to mention, that we were in want of a
school-mistress.&nbsp; She eagerly adopted the plan, and
persevering in it these last ten years, I find her a most
valuable acquisition to our society.</p>
<p>She was formed to shine in the most brilliant circle&mdash;yet
she relinquished it, and patiently labours to <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>improve the
children consigned to her management, and tranquillize her own
mind.&nbsp; She succeeds in both.</p>
<p>She lives indeed alone, and has all day only the society of
children; yet she enjoys many true pleasures; dependence on God
is her support, and devotion her comfort.&nbsp; Her lively
affections are therefore changed into a love of virtue and truth:
and these exalted speculations have given an uncommon dignity to
her manners; for she seems above the world, and its trifling
commotions.&nbsp; At her meals, gratitude to Heaven supplies the
place of society.&nbsp; She has a tender, social heart, and, as
she cannot sweeten her solitary draught, by expressing her good
wishes to her fellow-creatures, an ejaculation to Heaven for the
welfare of her friends is the substitute.&nbsp; This circumstance
I heard her mention to her grandfather, who sometimes visits
her.</p>
<p>I will now make some alteration in my dress, for when I visit
those who have been reduced from their original place in society
by misfortunes, I always attend a little to ceremony; lest too
much familiarity should appear like disrespect.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Visit to the School-mistress.&mdash;True and
false Pride.</p>
<p>Their dress was soon adjusted, and the girls plucked flowers
to adorn themselves, and a nosegay to present to the
school-mistress, whose garden was but small.</p>
<p>They met the children just released from confinement; the
swarm came humming round Mrs. Mason, endeavouring to catch her
eye, and obtain the notice they were so proud of.&nbsp; The girls
made their best courtesies, blushing; and the boys hung down
their <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>heads, and kicked up the dust, in scraping a bow of
respect.</p>
<p>They found their mistress preparing to drink tea, to refresh
herself after the toils of the day; and, with the ease peculiar
to well-bred people, she quickly enabled them to partake of it,
by giving the tea-board a more sociable appearance.</p>
<p>The harvest-home was soon the subject of conversation, and the
harper was mentioned.&nbsp; The family pride of the Welsh, said
Anna, has often diverted me; I have frequently heard the
inhabitants of a little hut, that could scarcely be distinguished
from the pig-sty, which stood in the front of it, boast of their
ancestors and despise trade.&nbsp; They have informed me, that
one branch of their family built the middle aisle of the church;
that another beautified the chancel, and gave the ten
commandments, which blaze there in letters of gold.&nbsp; Some
rejoice that their forefathers sleep in the most conspicuous
tombs&mdash;and that their ashes have an inscription to point out
where they are returning to their mother earth.&nbsp; And those
graves, which only a little stone at the head gives consequence
to, are adorned every Sunday with flowers, or ever-greens.&nbsp;
We perceive, in all the various customs of men, a desire to live
in the past and in the future, if I may be allowed the
expression.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason then observed, that of all the species of pride
which carry a man out of himself, family pride was the most
beneficial to society.&nbsp; Pride of wealth produces vanity and
ostentation; but that of blood seems to inspire high notions of
honour, and to banish meanness.&nbsp; Yet it is productive of
many ill consequences, the most obvious is, that it renders
individuals respectable to the generality, whose merit is only
reflected: and sometimes the want of this accidental advantage
throws the most shining personal <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>virtues and abilities into
obscurity.&nbsp; In weak minds this pride degenerates into the
most despicable folly; and the wise will not condescend to accept
of fame at second-hand, replied Anna.&nbsp; We ought to be proud
of our original, but we should trace it to our Heavenly Father,
who breathed into us the breath of life.&mdash;We are His
children when we try to resemble Him, when we are convinced that
truth and goodness must constitute the very essence of the soul;
and that the pursuit of them will produce happiness, when the
vain distinctions of mortals will fade away, and their pompous
escutcheons moulder with more vulgar dust!&nbsp; But remember, my
young friends, virtue is immortal; and goodness arises from a
quick perception of truth, and actions conformable to the
conviction.</p>
<p>Different subjects beguiled the time, till the closing evening
admonished them to return home; and they departed reluctantly,
filled with respect.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Charity.&mdash;The History of Peggy and her
Family.&mdash;The Sailor&rsquo;s Widow.</p>
<p>I have often remarked to you, said Mrs. Mason, one morning, to
her pupils, that we are all dependent on each other; and this
dependence is wisely ordered by our Heavenly Father, to call
forth many virtues, to exercise the best affections of the human
heart, and fix them into habits.&nbsp; While we impart pleasure
we receive it, and feel the grandeur of our immortal soul, as it
is constantly struggling to spread itself into futurity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest pleasure I have ever received, has arisen
from the habitual exercise of charity, in its various branches:
the view of a distressed object has <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>made me now think of conversing about
one branch of it, that of giving alms.</p>
<p>You know Peggy, the young girl whom I wish to have most about
my person; I mean, I wish it for her own sake, that I may have an
opportunity of improving her mind, and cultivating a good
capacity.&nbsp; As to attendance, I never give much trouble to
any fellow-creature; for I choose to be independent of caprice
and artificial wants; unless indeed, when I am sick; then, I
thankfully receive the assistance I would willingly give to
others in the same situation.&nbsp; I believe I have not in the
world a more faithful friend than Peggy; and her earnest desire
to please me gratifies my benevolence, for I always observe with
delight the workings of a grateful heart.</p>
<p>I lost a darling child, said Mrs. Mason, smothering a sigh, in
the depth of winter&mdash;death had before deprived me of her
father, and when I lost my child&mdash;he died again.</p>
<p>The wintery prospects suiting the temper of my soul, I have
sat looking at a wide waste of trackless snow for hours; and the
heavy sullen fog, that the feeble rays of the sun could not
pierce, gave me back an image of my mind.&nbsp; I was unhappy,
and the sight of dead nature accorded with my feelings&mdash;for
all was dead to me.</p>
<p>As the snow began to melt, I took a walk, and observed the
birds hopping about with drooping wings, or mute on the leafless
boughs.&nbsp; The mountain, whose sides had lost the snow, looked
black; yet still some remained on the summit, and formed a
contrast to diversify the dreary prospect.</p>
<p>I walked thoughtfully along, when the appearance of a poor
man, who did not beg, struck me very forcibly.&nbsp; His
shivering limbs were scarcely sheltered from the cold by the
tattered garments that covered <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>him; and he had a sharp, famished
look.&nbsp; I stretched out my hand with some relief in it, I
would not enquire into the particulars of such obvious
distress.&nbsp; The poor wretch caught my hand, and hastily
dropping on his knees, thanked me in an extacy, as if he had
almost lost sight of hope, and was overcome by the sudden
relief.&nbsp; His attitude, for I cannot bear to see a
fellow-creature kneel, and eager thanks, oppressed my weak
spirits, so that I could not for a moment ask him any more
questions; but as soon as I recollected myself, I learned from
him the misfortunes that had reduced him to such extreme
distress, and he hinted, that I could not easily guess the good I
had done.&nbsp; I imagined from this hint that he was meditating
his own destruction when I saw him, to spare himself the misery
of seeing his infant perish,&mdash;starved to death, in every
sense of the word.</p>
<p>I will now hasten to the sequel of the account.&nbsp; His wife
had lately had a child, she was very ill at the time, and want of
proper food, and a defence against the inclemency of the weather,
hurried her out of the world.&nbsp; The poor child, Peggy, had
sucked in disease and nourishment together, and now even that
wretched source had failed&mdash;the breast was cold that had
afforded the scanty support; and the little innocent smiled,
unconscious of its misery.&nbsp; I sent for her, added Mrs.
Mason, and her father dying a few years after, she has ever been
a favourite charge of mine, and nursing of her, in some measure,
dispelled the gloom in which I had been almost lost.&mdash;Ah! my
children, you know not how many, &lsquo;houseless heads bide the
pitiless storm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I received soon after a lesson of resignation from a poor
woman, who was a practical philosopher.</p>
<p>She had lost her husband, a sailor, and lost his wages also,
as she could not prove his death.&nbsp; She <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>came to me to
beg some pieces of silk, to make some pin-cushions for the
boarders of a neighbouring school.&nbsp; Her lower weeds were
patched with different coloured rags; but they spoke not variety
of wretchedness, on the contrary, they shewed a mind so content,
that want, and bodily pain, did not prevent her thinking of the
opinion of casual observers.&nbsp; This woman lost a husband and
a child suddenly, and her daily bread was precarious.&mdash;I
cheered the widow&rsquo;s heart, and my own was not quite
solitary.</p>
<p>But I am growing melancholy, whilst I am only desirous of
pointing out to you how very beneficial charity is&mdash;because
it enables us to find comfort when all our worldly comforts are
blighted: besides, when our bowels yearn to our fellow-creatures,
we feel that the love of God dwelleth in us&mdash;and then we
cannot always go on our way sorrowing.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Visit to Mrs. Trueman.&mdash;The Use of
Accomplishments.&mdash;Virtue the Soul of all.</p>
<p>In the afternoon they visited Mrs. Trueman unexpectedly, and
found her sitting in the garden playing to her children, who
danced on the green sod.&nbsp; She approached to receive them,
and laid aside her guitar; but, after some conversation, Mrs.
Mason desired her to take it up again, and the girls joined in
the request.&nbsp; While she was singing Mary whispered Mrs.
Mason, that she would give the world to be able to sing as
well.&nbsp; The whisper was not so low but a part of it reached
Mrs. Trueman&rsquo;s ears, who said to her, smiling, my young
friend, you value accomplishments much too highly&mdash;they may
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>give grace
to virtue&mdash;but are nothing without solid
worth.&mdash;Indeed, I may say more, for any thing like
perfection in the arts cannot be attained, where a relish; nay, a
delight in what is true and noble is wanting.&nbsp; A superficial
observer may be pleased with a picture in which fine colours
predominate; and quick movements in music may tickle the ear,
though they never reach the heart: but it is the simple strain
which affection animates, that we listen to with interest and
delight.&nbsp; Mr. Trueman has a taste for the fine arts; and I
wish in every thing to be his companion.&nbsp; His conversation
has improved my judgment, and the affection an intimate knowledge
of his virtues has inspired, increases the love which I feel for
the whole human race.&nbsp; He lives retired from the world; to
amuse him after the business of the day is over, and my babes
asleep, I sing to him.&nbsp; A desire to please, and the pleasure
I read in his eyes, give to my music energy and tenderness.&nbsp;
When he is ruffled by worldly cares, I try to smooth his wrinkled
brow, and think mine a voice of melody, when it has had that
effect.</p>
<p>Very true, replied Mrs. Mason, accomplishments should be
cultivated to render us pleasing to our domestic friends; virtue
is necessary; it must ever be the foundation of our peace and
usefulness; but when we are capable of affection, we wish to have
something peculiar to ourselves.&nbsp; We study the taste of our
friends, and endeavour to conform to it; but, in doing so, we
ought rather to improve our own abilities than servilely to copy
theirs.&nbsp; Observe, my dear girls, Mrs. Trueman&rsquo;s
distinction, her accomplishments are for her friends, her virtues
for the world in general.</p>
<p>I should think myself vain, and my soul little, answered Mrs.
Trueman, if the applause of the whole world, on the score of
abilities, which did not add <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>any real lustre to my character,
could afford me matter of exultation.&nbsp; The approbation of my
own heart, the humble hope of pleasing the Most High, elevates my
soul; and I feel, that in a future state, I may enjoy an
unspeakable degree of happiness, though I now only experience a
faint foretaste.&nbsp; Next to these sublime emotions, which I
cannot describe, and the joy resulting from doing good; I am
happy when I can amuse those I love; it is not then vanity, but
tenderness, that spurs me on, and my songs, my drawings, my every
action, has something of my heart in it.&nbsp; When I can add to
the innocent enjoyments of my children, and improve them at the
same time, are not my accomplishments of use?&nbsp; In the same
style, when I vary the pleasures of my fire-side, I make my
husband forget that it is a lonely one; and he returns to look
for elegance at home, elegance that he himself gave the polish
to; and which is only affected, when it does not flow from
virtuous affections.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon, I expatiate too long on my favourite topic;
my desire to rectify your notions must plead my excuse.</p>
<p>Mr. Trueman now joined them, and brought with him some of his
finest fruit.&nbsp; After tea Mrs. Trueman shewed them some of
her drawings; and, to comply with their repeated request, played
on the harpsichord, and Mr. Trueman took his violin to accompany
her.&nbsp; Then the children were indulged with a dance, each had
her favourite tune played in turn.</p>
<p>As they returned home, the girls were eagerly lavishing
praises on Mrs. Trueman; and Mary said, I cannot tell why, but I
feel so glad when she takes notice of me.&nbsp; I never saw any
one look so good-natured, cried Caroline.&nbsp; Mrs. Mason joined
in the conversation.&nbsp; You justly remarked that she is <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>good-natured;
you remember her history, she loves truth, and she is ever
exercising benevolence and love&mdash;from the insect, that she
avoids treading on, her affection may be traced to that Being who
lives for ever.&mdash;And it is from her goodness her agreeable
qualities spring.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">The Benefit of bodily Pain.&mdash;Fortitude
the Basis of Virtue.&mdash;The Folly of Irresolution.</p>
<p>The children had been playing in the garden for some time,
whilst Mrs. Mason was reading alone.&nbsp; But she was suddenly
alarmed by the cries of Caroline, who ran into the room in great
distress.&nbsp; Mary quickly followed, and explaining the matter
said, that her sister had accidentally disturbed some wasps, who
were terrified, and of course stung her.&nbsp; Remedies were
applied to assuage the pain; yet all the time she uttered the
loudest and most silly complaints, regardless of the uneasiness
she gave those who were exerting themselves to relieve her.</p>
<p>In a short time the smart abated, and then her friend thus
addressed her, with more than usual gravity.&nbsp; I am sorry to
see a girl of your age weep on account of bodily pain; it is a
proof of a weak mind&mdash;a proof that you cannot employ
yourself about things of consequence.&nbsp; How often must I tell
you that the Most High is educating us for eternity?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The term virtue, comes from a word signifying
strength.&nbsp; Fortitude of mind is, therefore, the basis of
every virtue, and virtue belongs to a being, that is weak in its
nature, and strong only in will and resolution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Children early feel bodily pain, to habituate them <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>to bear the
conflicts of the soul, when they become reasonable
creatures.&nbsp; This, I say, is the first trial, and I like to
see that proper pride which strives to conceal its
sufferings.&nbsp; Those who, when young, weep if the least trifle
annoys them, will never, I fear, have sufficient strength of
mind, to encounter all the miseries that can afflict the body,
rather than act meanly to avoid them.&nbsp; Indeed, this seems to
be the essential difference between a great and a little mind:
the former knows how to endure&mdash;whilst the latter suffers an
immortal soul to be depressed, lost in its abode; suffers the
inconveniences which attack the one to overwhelm the other.&nbsp;
The soul would always support the body, if its superiority was
felt, and invigorated by exercise.&nbsp; The Almighty, who never
afflicts but to produce some good end, first sends diseases to
children to teach them patience and fortitude; and when by
degrees they have learned to bear them, they have acquired some
virtue.</p>
<p>In the same manner, cold or hunger, when accidentally
encountered, are not evils; they make <i>us feel what wretches
feel</i>, and teach us to be tender-hearted.&nbsp; Many of your
fellow-creatures daily bear what you cannot for a moment endure
without complaint.&nbsp; Besides, another advantage arises from
it, after you have felt hunger, you will not be very anxious to
choose the particular kind of food that is to satisfy it.&nbsp;
You will then be freed from a frivolous care.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to take a nauseous draught, swallow it at
once, and do not make others sick whilst you are hesitating,
though you know that you ought to take it.&nbsp; If a tooth is to
be drawn, or any other disagreeable operation to be performed,
determine resolutely that it shall be done immediately; and
debate not, when you clearly see the step that you ought to
take.&nbsp; If I see a child act in this way, I am <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>ready to
embrace it, my soul yearns for it&mdash;I perceive the dawning of
a character that will be useful to society, as it prepares its
soul for a nobler field of action.</p>
<p>Believe me, it is the patient endurance of pain, that will
enable you to resist your passions; after you have borne bodily
pain, you will have firmness enough to sustain the still more
excruciating agonies of the mind.&nbsp; You will not, to banish
momentary cares, plunge into dissipation, nor to escape a present
inconvenience, forget that you should hold fast virtue as the
only substantial good.</p>
<p>I should not value the affection of a person who would not
bear pain and hunger to serve me; nor is that benevolence warm,
which shrinks from encountering difficulties, when it is
necessary, in order to be useful to any fellow-creature.</p>
<p>There is a just pride, a noble ambition in some minds, that I
greatly admire.&nbsp; I have seen a little of it in Mary! for
whilst she pities others, she imagines that she could bear their
inconveniences herself; and she seems to feel more uneasiness,
when she observes the sufferings of others, than I could ever
trace on her countenance under the immediate pressure of
pain.</p>
<p>Remember you are to bear patiently the infirmities of the
weakest of your fellow-creatures; but to yourselves you are not
to be equally indulgent.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Journey to London.</p>
<p>The girls were visibly improved; an air of intelligence began
to animate Caroline&rsquo;s fine features; and benevolence gave
her eyes the humid sparkle which is so beautiful and
engaging.&nbsp; The interest that we <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>take in the fate of others, attaches
them to ourselves;&mdash;thus Caroline&rsquo;s goodness inspired
more affection than her beauty.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s judgment grew every day clearer; or, more
properly speaking, she acquired experience; and her lively
feelings fixed the conclusions of reason in her mind.&nbsp;
Whilst Mrs. Mason was rejoicing in their apparent improvement,
she received a letter from their father, requesting her to allow
his daughters to spend the winter in town, as he wished to
procure them the best masters, an advantage that the country did
not afford.&nbsp; With reluctance she consented, determining to
remain with them a short time; and preparations were quickly made
for the journey.</p>
<p>The wished for morning arrived, and they set off in a tumult
of spirits; sorry to leave the country, yet delighted with the
prospect of visiting the metropolis.&nbsp; This hope soon dried
the tears which had bedewed their cheeks; for the parting with
Mrs. Mason was not anticipated.&nbsp; The autumnal views were new
to them; they saw the hedges exhibit various colours, and the
trees stripped of their leaves; but they were not disposed to
moralize.</p>
<p>For some time after their arrival, every thing they saw
excited wonder and admiration; and not till they were a little
familiarized with the new objects, did they ask reasonable
questions.</p>
<p>Several presents recruited their purses; and they requested
Mrs. Mason to allow them to buy some trifles they were in want
of.&nbsp; The request was modest, and she complied.</p>
<h3><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Charity.&mdash;Shopping.&mdash;The distressed
Stationer.&mdash;Mischievous Consequences of delaying
Payment.</p>
<p>As they walked in search of a shop, they both determined to
purchase pocket-books; but their friend desired them not to spend
all their money at once, as they would meet many objects of
charity in the numerous streets of the metropolis.&nbsp; I do not
wish you, she continued, to relieve every beggar that you
casually meet; yet should any one attract your attention, obey
the impulse of your heart, which will lead you to pay them for
exercising your compassion, and do not suffer the whispers of
selfishness, that they may be impostors, to deter you.&nbsp;
However, I would have you give but a trifle when you are not
certain the distress is real, and reckon it given for
pleasure.&nbsp; I for my part would rather be deceived five
hundred times, than doubt once without reason.</p>
<p>They stopped at a small shop, Mrs. Mason always sought out
such; for, said she, I may help those who perhaps want
assistance; bargains I never seek, for I wish every one to
receive the just value for their goods.</p>
<p>In the shop which they chanced to enter, they did not find the
kind of pocket-book that they had previously fixed on, and
therefore wished precipitately to leave it; but were detained by
their more considerate friend.&nbsp; While they had been turning
over the trinkets, the countenance of the woman, who served them,
caught her eye, and she observed her eager manner of recommending
the books.&nbsp; You have given much unnecessary trouble, said
she, to the mistress of the shop; the books are better, and more
expensive than <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>you intended to purchase, but I will make up the
deficiency.&nbsp; A beam of pleasure enlivened the woman&rsquo;s
swollen eyes; and Mrs. Mason, in the mild accents of compassion,
said, if it is not an impertinent question, will you tell me from
what cause your visible distress arises? perhaps I may have it in
my power to relieve you.&mdash;The woman burst into
tears.&mdash;Indeed, Madam, you have already relieved me; for the
money you have laid out will enable me to procure some food for
my poor little grandchildren, and to send a meal to their poor
father, who is now confined for debt, though a more honest man
never breathed.&nbsp; Ah! Madam, I little thought I should come
to this&mdash;Yesterday his wife died, poor soul!&nbsp; I really
believe things going so cross broke her heart.&nbsp; He has been
in jail these five months; I could not manage the shop, or buy
what was proper to keep up the credit of it, so business has been
continually falling off; yet, if his debts were paid, he would
now be here, and we should have money in our pockets.&nbsp; And
what renders it more provoking, the people who owe us most are
very rich.&nbsp; It is true, they live in such a very high style,
and keep such a number of horses and servants, that they are
often in want of money, and when they have it, they mostly have
some freak in their heads, and do not think of paying poor
trades-people.&nbsp; At first we were afraid to ask for payment
lest we should lose their custom, and so it proved; when we did
venture, forced by necessity, they sent to other shops, without
discharging our demand.</p>
<p>And, my dear Madam, this is not all my grief; my son, before
his misfortunes, was one of the most sober, industrious young men
in London; but now he is not like the same man.&nbsp; He had
nothing to do in the jail, and to drive away care he learned to
drink; he <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>said it was a comfort to forget himself, and he would
add an oath&mdash;I never heard him swear till then.&nbsp; I took
pains when he was a child to teach him his prayers, and he
rewarded me by being a dutiful son.&nbsp; The case is quite
altered now&mdash;he seems to have lost all natural
affection&mdash;he heeds not his mother&rsquo;s tears.&mdash;Her
sobs almost suffocated her, as she strove to go on&mdash;He will
bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave&mdash;and yet I pity
my poor boy, he is shut up with such a number of profligate
wretches, who laugh at what is right.&nbsp; Every farthing I send
him he spends in liquor, and used to make his poor wife pawn her
clothes to buy him drink&mdash;she was happy to die, it was well
for her not to live to hear the babe she gave suck to despise
her!</p>
<p>A passion of tears relieved the sufferer, and she called her
grandchildren; these innocent babes, said she, I shall not be
able to keep them, they must go to the workhouse.&nbsp; If the
quality did but know what they make us poor industrious people
suffer&mdash;surely they would be more considerate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason gave her something to supply her present wants, and
promised to call on her again before she left town.</p>
<p>They walked silently down two or three streets; I hope you
have learned to think, my dear girls, said Mrs. Mason, and that
your hearts have felt the emotions of compassion; need I make any
comments on the situation of the poor woman we have just
left.&nbsp; You perceive that those who neglect to pay their
debts, do more harm than they imagine; perhaps, indeed, some of
these very people do, what is called, a noble action, give away a
large sum, and are termed generous; nay, very probably, weep at a
tragedy, or when reading an affecting tale.&nbsp; They then boast
of their sensibility&mdash;when, alas! neglecting the foundation
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of all
virtue, <i>justice</i>, they have occasioned exquisite
distress;&mdash;led a poor wretch into vice; heaped misery on
helpless infancy, and drawn tears from the aged widow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Visit to a poor Family in
London.&mdash;Idleness the Parent of Vice.&mdash;Prodigality and
Generosity incompatible.&mdash;The Pleasures of
Benevolence.&mdash;True and false Motives for saving.</p>
<p>After the impression which the story, and the sight of the
family had made, was a little worn off; Caroline begged leave to
buy one toy, and then another, till her money was quite
gone.&nbsp; When Mrs. Mason found it was all expended, she looked
round for an object in distress; a poor woman soon presented
herself, and her meagre countenance gave weight to her
tale.&mdash;A babe, as meagre, hung at her breast, which did not
seem to contain sufficient moisture to wet its parched lips.</p>
<p>On enquiry they found that she lodged in a neighbouring
garret.&nbsp; Her husband had been out of employment a long time,
and was now sick.&nbsp; The master who had formerly given him
work, lost gradually great part of his business; for his best
customers were grown so fond of foreign articles, that his goods
grew old in the warehouse.&nbsp; Consequently a number of hands
were dismissed, who not immediately finding employment elsewhere,
were reduced to the most extreme distress.&nbsp; The truth of
this account a reputable shopkeeper attested; and he added that
many of the unhappy creatures, who die unpitied at the gallows,
were first led into vice by accidental idleness.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>They
ascended the dark stairs, scarcely able to bear the bad smells
that flew from every part of a small house, that contained in
each room a family, occupied in such an anxious manner to obtain
the necessaries of life, that its comforts never engaged their
thoughts.&nbsp; The precarious meal was snatched, and the stomach
did not turn, though the cloth, on which it was laid, was died in
dirt.&nbsp; When to-morrow&rsquo;s bread is uncertain, who thinks
of cleanliness?&nbsp; Thus does despair increase the misery, and
consequent disease aggravate the horrors of poverty!</p>
<p>They followed the woman into a low garret, that was never
visited by the chearful rays of the sun.&mdash;A man, with a
sallow complexion, and long beard, sat shivering over a few
cinders in the bottom of a broken grate, and two more children
were on the ground, half naked, near him, breathing the same
noxious air.&nbsp; The gaiety natural to their age, did not
animate their eyes, half sunk in their sockets; and, instead of
smiles, premature wrinkles had found a place in their lengthened
visages.&nbsp; Life was nipped in the bud; shut up just as it
began to unfold itself.&nbsp; &lsquo;A frost, a killing
frost,&rsquo; had destroyed the parent&rsquo;s hopes; they seemed
to come into the world only to crawl half formed,&mdash;to
suffer, and to die.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason desired the girls to relieve the family; Caroline
hung down her head abashed&mdash;wishing the paltry ornaments
which she had thoughtlessly bought, in the bottom of the
sea.&nbsp; Mary, meanwhile, proud of the new privilege, emptied
her purse; and Caroline, in a supplicating tone, entreated Mrs.
Mason to allow her to give her neck-handkerchief to the little
infant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason desired the woman to call on her the next day; and
they left the family cheered by their bounty.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Caroline expected the reproof that soon proceeded from
the mouth of her true friend.&nbsp; I am glad that this accident
has occurred, to prove to you that prodigality and generosity are
incompatible.&nbsp; Economy and self-denial are necessary in
every station, to enable us to be generous, and to act
conformably to the rules of justice.</p>
<p>Mary may this night enjoy peaceful slumbers; idle Fancies,
foolishly indulged, will not float in her brain; she may, before
she closes her eyes, thank God, for allowing her to be His
instrument of mercy.&nbsp; Will the trifles that you have
purchased, afford you such heartfelt delight, Caroline?</p>
<p>Selfish people save to gratify their own caprices and
appetites; the benevolent curb both, to give scope to the nobler
feelings of the human heart.&nbsp; When we squander money idly,
we defraud the poor, and deprive our own souls of their most
exalted food.&nbsp; If you wish to be useful, govern your
desires, and wait not till distress obtrudes itself&mdash;search
it out.&nbsp; In the country it is not always attended with such
shocking circumstances as at present; but in large cities, many
garrets contain families, similar to those we have seen this
afternoon.&nbsp; The money spent in indulging the vain wishes of
idleness, and a childish fondness for pretty things not regulated
by reason, would relieve the misery that my soul shrinks back
from contemplating.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Mrs. Mason&rsquo;s farewell Advice to her
young Friends.</p>
<p>The day before Mrs. Mason was to leave her pupils, she took a
hand of each, and pressing them tenderly in her own, tears
started into her eyes&mdash;I tremble for <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>you, my dear
girls, for you must now practise by yourselves some of the
virtues which I have been endeavouring to inculcate; and I shall
anxiously wait for the summer, to see what progress you have made
by yourselves.</p>
<p>We have conversed on several very important subjects; pray do
not forget the conclusions I have drawn.&nbsp; I now, as my last
present, give you a book, in which I have written the subjects
that we have discussed.&nbsp; Recur frequently to it, for the
stories illustrating the instruction it contains, you will not
feel in such a great degree the want of my personal advice.&nbsp;
Some of the reasoning you may not thoroughly comprehend, but, as
your understandings ripen, you will feel its full force.</p>
<p>Avoid anger; exercise compassion; and love truth.&nbsp;
Recollect, that from religion your chief comfort must spring, and
never neglect the duty of prayer.&nbsp; Learn from experience the
comfort that arises from making known your wants and sorrows to
the wisest and best of Beings, in whose hands are the issues, not
only of this life, but of that which is to come.</p>
<p>Your father will allow you a certain stipend; you have already
<i>felt</i> the pleasure of doing good; ever recollect that the
wild pursuits of fancy must be conquered, to enable you to
gratify benevolent wishes, and that you must practise economy in
trifles to have it in your power to be generous on great
occasions.&nbsp; And the good you intend to do, do
quickly;&mdash;for know that a trifling duty neglected, is a
great fault, and the present time only is at your command.</p>
<p>You are now candidates for my friendship, and on your
advancement in virtue my regard will in future depend.&nbsp;
Write often to me, I will punctually answer your letters; but let
me have the genuine sentiments of your hearts.&nbsp; In
expressions of affection and <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>respect, do not deviate from truth to
gain what you wish for, or to turn a period prettily.</p>
<p>Adieu! when you think of your friend, observe her precepts;
and let the recollection of my affection, give additional weight
to the truths which I have endeavoured to instill; and, to reward
my care, let me hear that you love and practice virtue.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
